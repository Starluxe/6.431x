1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,020
Hi.

2
00:00:01,020 --> 00:00:02,200
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:05,010
Today, we're going to do a fun
problem called the chess

4
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:07,280
tournament problem.

5
00:00:07,280 --> 00:00:10,640
Now, it's a very long problem,
so I just want to jump

6
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:11,870
straight in.

7
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,300
Essentially, the problem
statement describes a very

8
00:00:15,300 --> 00:00:20,080
special chess tournament, which
involves players named

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,150
Al, Bo, and Chi.

10
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:27,710
Now Al is the current reigning
[champion], and Bo and Chi are

11
00:00:27,710 --> 00:00:30,740
this year's contenders, and, of
course, they're vying with

12
00:00:30,740 --> 00:00:35,040
each other to beat out Al and
become the new champion.

13
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,460
And so essentially,
the tournament is

14
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:40,490
divided into two rounds--

15
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:43,470
a first round, during which Bo
and Chi play against each

16
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,230
other, and then a second
round, during which the

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:51,390
surviving contender from the
first round plays against Al.

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,750
And the problem statement also
gives you a bunch of

19
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:57,760
information like what's the
probability that Bo beats Chi

20
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,820
in a particular game,
et cetera.

21
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,040
So without further ado, let's
get started on part (a).

22
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:07,910
In part (a), the first thing
we're asked to compute is the

23
00:01:07,910 --> 00:01:11,410
probability that a second
round is required.

24
00:01:11,410 --> 00:01:15,530
Now, to save myself some
writing, I used the notation

25
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,870
R2 to denote that event.

26
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:24,300
So we are interested in
probability of R2.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,170
Now, I claim that this problem
is very sequential in nature

28
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:32,440
so I would like to draw a tree
to describe what's happening.

29
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:36,380
So in the first part of the
tournament, when Bo and Chi

30
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:41,060
play their first game, exactly
one of two things can happen--

31
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:44,370
either Bo can win
or Chi can win.

32
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:47,630
And we're told by the problem
statement that Bo wins with

33
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:51,610
the probability of 0.6 and,
therefore, Chi must win with

34
00:01:51,610 --> 00:01:53,600
the probability of 0.4, right?

35
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:56,580
Because these two possibilities
must sum to 1,

36
00:01:56,580 --> 00:02:01,190
because either this must
happen or this happen.

37
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:04,490
Now, let's imagine that the
first game has been played and

38
00:02:04,490 --> 00:02:06,210
that Bo won.

39
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,800
Well, during the second game,
there's still two options for

40
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:10,340
the outcome--

41
00:02:10,340 --> 00:02:12,345
Bo could win the second
game or Chi could

42
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:14,380
win the second game.

43
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,830
And because the problem
statement says that in every

44
00:02:17,830 --> 00:02:20,310
scenario Bo always wins
against Chi with the

45
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:24,640
probability of 0.6, we can go
ahead and put a 0.6 along this

46
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,200
branch as well.

47
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:28,060
Similarly, 0.4 here.

48
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,290
And similar logic, you've got
a tree that looks like this.

49
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:36,440
And for those of you who haven't
seen trees before,

50
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:39,650
it's just a structure that looks
something like this.

51
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:41,920
And it helps us do better
accounting.

52
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:45,060
It helps us keep straight in our
head what are the various

53
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,870
outcomes, so that we
don't get confused.

54
00:02:47,870 --> 00:02:51,160
And so very quickly here, you
can see that there's four

55
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:53,410
possible outcomes.

56
00:02:53,410 --> 00:02:56,490
So each node in this tree
corresponds to an outcome.

57
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,170
And the leaves are those nodes
at the furthest stage.

58
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:04,840
And it's convention to draw
the probability of a

59
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:05,900
particular--

60
00:03:05,900 --> 00:03:09,480
so for instance, the probability
that Bo wins the

61
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:11,470
first game-- it's just
convention to draw that

62
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:15,560
probability over the
corresponding branch.

63
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:19,440
And the reason why such diagrams
are so useful is

64
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:21,980
because to compute the
probability of a particular

65
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:26,070
outcome, if you've designed your
tree correctly, all you

66
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,650
have to do is multiply the
probabilities along the

67
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,980
branches that get into
that outcome.

68
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,530
So let's see that in action.

69
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:36,800
When is a second
round required?

70
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,670
Well, a second round is
required here, right?

71
00:03:42,670 --> 00:03:45,450
Because in this case, Bo would
be the surviving challenger

72
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,730
and he'd play the next
round against Al.

73
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:50,420
It's also required here.

74
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:53,400
But of course, it's not required
here or here, because

75
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,100
no second round is played.

76
00:03:56,100 --> 00:04:01,020
And so these two outcomes
comprise the event R2.

77
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:05,060
And now, to get the probability
of this outcome,

78
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,790
you multiply along
the branches.

79
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:09,980
So 0.6 times 0.6
give you 0.36.

80
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:13,770
And 0.4 times 0.4
gives you 0.16.

81
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,360
And we're almost done.

82
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:22,040
We know that these two events
are disjoint, because if Bo

83
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:24,990
won the first two games, then,
certainly, Chi couldn't have

84
00:04:24,990 --> 00:04:27,010
won the first two games.

85
00:04:27,010 --> 00:04:29,800
And so you can just sum the
probabilities to get the

86
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,930
probability of the
their union.

87
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:38,070
So the probability of R2 is
equal to the probability that

88
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:44,090
Bo won the first two games or
Chi won the first two games.

89
00:04:44,090 --> 00:04:52,640
And that's equal to 0.36 plus
0.16, which is equal to 0.52.

90
00:04:52,640 --> 00:04:57,000
OK, now the second part of
part (a) asks for the

91
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,260
probability that Bo wins
the first round.

92
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:04,430
And this is first round.

93
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,060
This is a very straightforward
one.

94
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:13,010
So Bo wins the first round, that
corresponds only to this

95
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,090
particular outcome.

96
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:16,440
And we already know the
probability associated with

97
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,760
that outcome is equal
to the 0.36.

98
00:05:19,760 --> 00:05:22,980
So we're done with that one.

99
00:05:22,980 --> 00:05:26,420
And now the last part is sort
of the interesting one.

100
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:29,460
It asks for the probability
that Al retains his

101
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,895
championship this year.

102
00:05:30,895 --> 00:05:34,010

103
00:05:34,010 --> 00:05:36,540
So I'm going to just call
that A for short.

104
00:05:36,540 --> 00:05:40,300
A is the event that Al retains
his championship this year.

105
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:44,200
And for that we're going to need
a larger tree, because Al

106
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:47,485
has a lot of activity in the
second round, and so far our

107
00:05:47,485 --> 00:05:51,060
tree only describes what happens
in the first round.

108
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:53,870
Now, to save time, I've actually
drawn the rest of the

109
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:57,360
tree over there, up
in the corner.

110
00:05:57,360 --> 00:05:59,410
So let's get rid of
this one and let's

111
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:02,050
look at the full tree.

112
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:06,320
So let's see when does Al
retain his championship?

113
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:11,900
Well, Al certainly retains his
championship here, right?

114
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:14,020
Because no second round
is required.

115
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:16,440
Similarly, here.

116
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,480
Al retains his championship
here, because the second round

117
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:22,940
was required, but Al beat Bo.

118
00:06:22,940 --> 00:06:27,610
And similarly, here Bo didn't
win both games in the second

119
00:06:27,610 --> 00:06:31,490
round against Al, so Al wins.

120
00:06:31,490 --> 00:06:34,140
Here, Bo is the new champion.

121
00:06:34,140 --> 00:06:36,230
So we don't want to
include about one.

122
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:38,440
And sort of by symmetry,
we also get this

123
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:40,150
one and this one.

124
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:43,610
So by my argument before, we
know that the outcomes that

125
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:47,810
comprise our event of interest
are this one, this one, this

126
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:49,680
one, this one, this
one, and this one.

127
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,750
So we could multiply the
probabilities along each

128
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,910
branch and sum them, because
they're disjoint, to get the

129
00:06:55,910 --> 00:06:57,390
total probability.

130
00:06:57,390 --> 00:06:58,850
But we're not going
to do that because

131
00:06:58,850 --> 00:07:00,060
that's a lot of algebra.

132
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:01,200
Instead, we're going
to look at the

133
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,170
complement of the event.

134
00:07:03,170 --> 00:07:06,620
So we're going to notice,
there's only two branches on

135
00:07:06,620 --> 00:07:10,370
which Al does not retain his
current championship.

136
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:18,160
So P of A is, of course, equal
to 1 minus P of A. And we're

137
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,120
going to get P of
A by inspection.

138
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,350
I'm sorry, so P of
A complement.

139
00:07:26,350 --> 00:07:28,290
I'm just testing you, guys.

140
00:07:28,290 --> 00:07:33,050
So P of A complement corresponds
to here and to

141
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:37,470
here, because those are the
outcomes where Al didn't win.

142
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:40,130
And so again, you multiply along
the branches to get the

143
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:41,380
probabilities.

144
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:50,060
So you get 0.6 squared times 0.5
squared plus 0.4 squared

145
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:52,830
times 0.3 squared.

146
00:07:52,830 --> 00:08:01,640
And if you do all the algebra,
you should get around 0.8956.

147
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:06,140
So we're cruising through
this problem.

148
00:08:06,140 --> 00:08:09,630
Let's go to part (b).

149
00:08:09,630 --> 00:08:12,960
Part (b) is a little bit less
straightforward than part (a),

150
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,660
because it starts asking you for
conditional probabilities,

151
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:20,380
as opposed to a priori
probabilities.

152
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:22,790
So in the first part--

153
00:08:22,790 --> 00:08:26,060
and again, I'm going to continue
my notation with R2--

154
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:29,060
we want the probability that
Bo is the surviving

155
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:29,690
challenger--

156
00:08:29,690 --> 00:08:32,549
so I'm just going to use
B to denote that--

157
00:08:32,549 --> 00:08:34,929
given R2.

158
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:38,240
Now, by definition, you should
remember from lecture that

159
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:44,970
this is equal to probability
of B and R2 divided by the

160
00:08:44,970 --> 00:08:48,120
probability of R2.

161
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:51,290
And of course, we've already
computed this value right up

162
00:08:51,290 --> 00:08:52,140
here with part (a).

163
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:54,510
We know it's 0.52.

164
00:08:54,510 --> 00:08:56,640
So we don't have to do
any more work there.

165
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,650
We only have to look
at the numerator.

166
00:09:01,650 --> 00:09:05,410
So we need to go and figure out
what nodes in that tree

167
00:09:05,410 --> 00:09:10,090
correspond to the event
B intersect R2.

168
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:13,860
So let's use a new color.

169
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:23,450
Let's see, Bo is the surviving
challenger here only, right?

170
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:26,830
And R2 is automatically
satisfied, right?

171
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:33,550
Because a second round is
required there and there, not

172
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,590
on those two.

173
00:09:34,590 --> 00:09:37,470
But here Chi is the surviving
challenger, not Bo, so we're

174
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:39,430
really only interested
in that node.

175
00:09:39,430 --> 00:09:41,530
And you multiply along the
branches to get the

176
00:09:41,530 --> 00:09:42,910
probabilities.

177
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:47,260
So we have 0.36 over
0.52, which is

178
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:52,240
approximately equal to 0.6923.

179
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:58,270
OK, now, the next part wants
the conditional probability

180
00:09:58,270 --> 00:10:01,370
that AL retains his
championship, conditioned,

181
00:10:01,370 --> 00:10:03,380
again, on R2.

182
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:06,680
So we already have A being
the event Al retains his

183
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,750
championship.

184
00:10:07,750 --> 00:10:12,930
So we want the probability
of A, given R2.

185
00:10:12,930 --> 00:10:15,920
And let's just apply the
direct definition of

186
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:18,140
conditional probability again.

187
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:25,800
You get P of A and R2 divided
by a probability of R2.

188
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:29,120
Of course, we have the
probability of R2 already, so

189
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:32,490
we just need to find the node
in the tree that corresponds

190
00:10:32,490 --> 00:10:35,890
to A and R2.

191
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:39,220
So where is R2?

192
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:42,810
R2 is going to correspond to
every node to the right that

193
00:10:42,810 --> 00:10:44,730
is not one of these two.

194
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:48,870
So a second round is required
here, here, here,

195
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,120
here, here, and here.

196
00:10:50,120 --> 00:10:52,710

197
00:10:52,710 --> 00:10:54,770
Now, where does Al retain
his championship?

198
00:10:54,770 --> 00:10:59,430
So Al retains his championship
here.

199
00:10:59,430 --> 00:11:02,440
He retains his championship
here.

200
00:11:02,440 --> 00:11:05,070
He retains his championship here
and here, but no second

201
00:11:05,070 --> 00:11:08,650
round is required, so these
guys don't belong in the

202
00:11:08,650 --> 00:11:10,310
intersection.

203
00:11:10,310 --> 00:11:13,290
But this does, and this does.

204
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:17,630
So we can again multiply the
probabilities along the

205
00:11:17,630 --> 00:11:20,060
branches and then some them.

206
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,290
So let's see, we get--

207
00:11:22,290 --> 00:11:25,290
this marker's not working very
well, so I'm going to switch

208
00:11:25,290 --> 00:11:27,270
back to the pink--

209
00:11:27,270 --> 00:11:32,520
so you get 0.6 squared
times 0.5.

210
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:34,950
That gets rid of this one.

211
00:11:34,950 --> 00:11:42,535
And then we want 0.6 squared
times 0.5 squared.

212
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:45,320
That gets rid of that one.

213
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,100
And then plus--

214
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,990
let's see--

215
00:11:47,990 --> 00:11:53,420
0.4 squared times 0.7, which
takes care of this one.

216
00:11:53,420 --> 00:12:04,650
And then lastly, 0.4 squared
times 0.3 times 0.7.

217
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:08,560
And that is a long expression.

218
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:17,860
But it happens to
be about 0.7992.

219
00:12:17,860 --> 00:12:22,620
OK, so we are done with part
(b) and we can move

220
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:24,920
along to part (c).

221
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:30,700
And I am, since we're running
out of room, I'm actually just

222
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:33,920
going to erase this.

223
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:36,160
And hopefully you guys
have had a chance to

224
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:37,270
copy it down by now.

225
00:12:37,270 --> 00:12:42,520
If not, you can always pause
the video and go back.

226
00:12:42,520 --> 00:12:51,480
So let's see, part (c) asks us
given that the second round is

227
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:55,960
required and that it comprised
of one game only.

228
00:12:55,960 --> 00:13:05,080
So let's denote I. So let's I
be the event that the second

229
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,030
round was one game only.

230
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:12,230

231
00:13:12,230 --> 00:13:16,520
So essentially, in math
conditioned on R2 and I, what

232
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:20,900
is the probability that it was
Bo who won the first round?

233
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:27,420
So let's let B be the event that
Bo won the first round.

234
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:30,850

235
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:34,310
OK, so again translating the
English to math, we just want

236
00:13:34,310 --> 00:13:44,620
the probability of B given R2
and I. Now, I am once again

237
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:49,410
going to use the definition of
conditional probability.

238
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:54,890
You might be concerned that we
haven't defined explicitly yet

239
00:13:54,890 --> 00:13:58,460
the definition of conditional
probability, when what lies

240
00:13:58,460 --> 00:14:02,780
behind the conditioning bar is
not a single event, but it's

241
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,980
rather an intersection
of an event.

242
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:09,940
And so my claim to you is that
it doesn't matter and that the

243
00:14:09,940 --> 00:14:11,480
same exact definition applies.

244
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:13,380
But we'll go through
it slowly.

245
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:18,710
So R2 is an event, I is an
event, and we know that the

246
00:14:18,710 --> 00:14:21,880
intersection of two events
is itself an event.

247
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:25,760
So I'm going to make up a new
letter, and I'm going to call

248
00:14:25,760 --> 00:14:33,030
this event W. So just using
the new notation, this is

249
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:37,950
equal to probability
of B, given W.

250
00:14:37,950 --> 00:14:40,280
Now, this is the normal
definition that we know.

251
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:44,460
We know that this is probability
of B intersect W

252
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:51,120
over probability of W. And then
we just resubstitute what

253
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:53,710
the definition of W was.

254
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:57,680
And so if you do that over here,
you get probability of B

255
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:06,480
and R2 and I divided by
probability of R2 and I.

256
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:10,230
So hopefully, jumping from here
ahead to here, you see

257
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:14,170
that the definitions act
exactly the same way.

258
00:15:14,170 --> 00:15:17,570
But these are two very short
intermediate steps that should

259
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:21,120
help you convince yourself
that the same

260
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,880
definition still works.

261
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:27,550
So let's start with the
denominator, because the

262
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:30,040
denominator looks a
little bit easier.

263
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:34,680
Where is R2 and I in our tree?

264
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:37,530
Well, let's see.

265
00:15:37,530 --> 00:15:39,970
Here, a second round was
required, but it

266
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,830
comprised two games.

267
00:15:41,830 --> 00:15:43,540
Same with this one.

268
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:46,830
Here, a second round was
required and it was comprised

269
00:15:46,830 --> 00:15:48,060
only of one game.

270
00:15:48,060 --> 00:15:49,132
So this is good.

271
00:15:49,132 --> 00:15:53,370
This is one of the outcomes
that we're looking for.

272
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:55,410
Here, no second round
was required.

273
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:56,590
So this doesn't qualify.

274
00:15:56,590 --> 00:15:58,020
Same with this one.

275
00:15:58,020 --> 00:16:01,530
Here, a second round was
required, and there was only

276
00:16:01,530 --> 00:16:03,430
one game, so that's good.

277
00:16:03,430 --> 00:16:06,080
And then these don't qualify
for the same reasons as we

278
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:07,370
said up there.

279
00:16:07,370 --> 00:16:09,010
So we just have to multiply the

280
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:12,800
probabilities along those branches.

281
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:18,350
And we see that it's 0.4 squared
times 0.7 plus 0.6

282
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:20,680
squared times 0.5.

283
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:22,200
OK, we're almost done.

284
00:16:22,200 --> 00:16:26,930
We just need to look at the
intersection of R2 and I. So

285
00:16:26,930 --> 00:16:29,570
R2 and I are the ones we've
already circled.

286
00:16:29,570 --> 00:16:33,990
But now, we want to add one more
constraint, which is that

287
00:16:33,990 --> 00:16:36,930
Bo had to have won
the first round.

288
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:41,100
And so we see here that Chi won
the first round, if we're

289
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,015
looking at this outcome.

290
00:16:42,015 --> 00:16:44,050
And so he's no good.

291
00:16:44,050 --> 00:16:45,960
Let's use a different color.

292
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,840
Let's see, maybe this one.

293
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,540
But here Bo did win
the first round.

294
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:57,160
So we're going to get 0.6
squared times 0.5.

295
00:16:57,160 --> 00:16:59,370
And I got that, of course,
just by multiplying the

296
00:16:59,370 --> 00:17:03,180
probabilities along the
right branches.

297
00:17:03,180 --> 00:17:11,069
And this, if you're curious,
comes out to be about 0.6164.

298
00:17:11,069 --> 00:17:15,819
OK, so I know that was a lengthy
problem, but you

299
00:17:15,819 --> 00:17:20,910
should feel really comfortable
now doing sort of basic

300
00:17:20,910 --> 00:17:22,819
probability manipulations.

301
00:17:22,819 --> 00:17:27,109
One thing that this problem
emphasized a lot was your

302
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:30,150
ability to compute conditional
probabilities.

303
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:33,190
So you saw me apply the
definition of conditional

304
00:17:33,190 --> 00:17:35,550
probability twice in part (b).

305
00:17:35,550 --> 00:17:38,880
And then you saw me apply the
definition again in part (c)

306
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:42,600
in a sort of slightly
modified way.

307
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,840
So that's one thing that
you should have

308
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,340
gotten out of this problem.

309
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:50,050
And then another thing is that
hopefully, you noticed that by

310
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:54,870
using a tree diagram, we made
the problem much easier.

311
00:17:54,870 --> 00:17:57,210
We almost didn't even have
to think about computing

312
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,750
probabilities anymore.

313
00:17:58,750 --> 00:18:02,450
We reduced the problem to just
saying, OK, what are the

314
00:18:02,450 --> 00:18:06,260
outcomes that comprise our
event of interest?

315
00:18:06,260 --> 00:18:08,620
And then once you select
those, to compute their

316
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:10,130
probability you multiply the

317
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:13,400
probabilities along the branches.

318
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:17,100
You have the right to just add
those together, because if you

319
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,200
draw your tree correctly, all
of these guys should be

320
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,200
disjoint from one another.

321
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:25,970
So you have to be careful, of
course, to set up your tree

322
00:18:25,970 --> 00:18:26,800
appropriately.

323
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:30,670
But once you do set up your tree
appropriately, your life

324
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,270
is much simpler.

325
00:18:32,270 --> 00:18:33,520
So that's it for today.

326
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:34,870
And we'll see you next time.

327
00:18:34,870 --> 00:18:36,234
