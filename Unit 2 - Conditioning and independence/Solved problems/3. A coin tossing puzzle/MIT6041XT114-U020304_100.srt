00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,080

2
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:00,880
Hi.

3
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,340
In this problem, we'll be going
over practice with the

4
00:00:03,340 --> 00:00:06,140
calculation of conditional
probabilities.

5
00:00:06,140 --> 00:00:09,580
We'll start with a game where
our friend Alice will be

6
00:00:09,580 --> 00:00:13,500
tossing a coin with certain
bias of having a head, and

7
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,170
tosses this coin twice.

8
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:16,520
And we're interested in
knowing, what's the

9
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,110
probability that both
coin tosses will

10
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:20,980
end up being a head?

11
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:23,500
The first step we're going to
do is to convert the problem

12
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:25,940
into a mathematical form
by defining two

13
00:00:25,940 --> 00:00:27,490
events as the following.

14
00:00:27,490 --> 00:00:31,430
Event A is where the first
coin toss is a head.

15
00:00:31,430 --> 00:00:35,200
And similarly, event B will be
having the second coin toss

16
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:37,050
also being a head.

17
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,910
Having these two events will
allow us to say, well, the

18
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:44,280
event that A intersection B will
be the event that both

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,640
coin tosses are a head.

20
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,640
And we'd like to know the
probability of such an event.

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,310
In particular, the probability
of A and B will be calculated

22
00:00:54,310 --> 00:00:57,040
under two types of
information.

23
00:00:57,040 --> 00:01:01,480
In the first case, we'll be
conditioning on that we know

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:04,879
the first coin toss is a head.

25
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,670
I'd like to know what the
probability of A and B is.

26
00:01:07,670 --> 00:01:12,160
In the second case, we know that
at least one of the two

27
00:01:12,160 --> 00:01:16,260
coin tosses is a head expressed
in the form A union

28
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:17,310
B.

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,560
And under this conditioning,
what is the probability of A

30
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:25,180
and B, A intersection B?

31
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:28,790
So Alice, in this problem,
says-- well, her guess will be

32
00:01:28,790 --> 00:01:31,980
that the first quantity
is no smaller

33
00:01:31,980 --> 00:01:33,630
than the second quantity.

34
00:01:33,630 --> 00:01:38,900
Namely, knowing that the first
coin toss is a head somehow

35
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:41,800
more strongly implies that both
coin tosses will be a

36
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,650
head, compared to the case that
we only know at least one

37
00:01:44,650 --> 00:01:46,610
of the two coin tosses
is a head.

38
00:01:46,610 --> 00:01:49,190
And we'd like to verify if this

39
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:51,440
inequality is indeed true.

40
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:54,970
To do so, let's just use the
basic calculation of

41
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:56,780
conditional probability.

42
00:01:56,780 --> 00:01:59,110
Now, from the lectures, you've
already learned that to

43
00:01:59,110 --> 00:02:02,880
calculate this quantity, we'll
write out a fraction where the

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,240
numerator is the probability of
the intersection of these

45
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:08,550
two events.

46
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:16,820
So we have A intersection B
intersection A, divided by the

47
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:19,410
probability of the event that
we're conditioning on, which

48
00:02:19,410 --> 00:02:23,000
is A.

49
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,140
Now, the top quantity, since
we know that A and B is a

50
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:32,110
subset of event A, then taking
the intersection of these two

51
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,190
quantities will just give
us the first event.

52
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:41,060
So we have A and B. And the
bottom is still probability of

53
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,560
A.

54
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,780
Let's do the same thing for
the second quantity here.

55
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:54,480
We have the top probability of A
and B intersection the event

56
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:02,430
A union B, and on the bottom,
probability of the event A and

57
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:08,930
B. Again, we see the event A and
B is a subset of the event

58
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:16,050
A union B. So the top will be
A and B. And the bottom--

59
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:19,990
A union B.

60
00:03:19,990 --> 00:03:23,070
OK, now let's stop
for a little bit.

61
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:28,230
We've computed the probability
for each expression in the

62
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,280
following fractional form.

63
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,610
And we observed that for
both fractions, the

64
00:03:32,610 --> 00:03:33,920
numerator is the same.

65
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:37,530
So the numerator is a
probability of A and B. And

66
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,590
the denominator in the first
case is probably of A, and the

67
00:03:41,590 --> 00:03:44,490
second case, probably
of A union B.

68
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:49,370
Since we know that A is a subset
of the event A union B,

69
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:53,120
and by the monotonicity of
probabilities, we know that

70
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,630
the probability of A is hence
no greater than the

71
00:03:56,630 --> 00:04:01,860
probability of A union B.
Substituting this back into

72
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:07,330
these expressions, we know that
because they lie in the

73
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:11,500
denominators, the first
expression is indeed no

74
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:13,430
smaller than the second
expression.

75
00:04:13,430 --> 00:04:16,690
So our friend Alice
was correct.

76
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:20,269
So throughout this problem, we
never used the fact that the

77
00:04:20,269 --> 00:04:25,160
probability of a particular coin
toss results, let's say,

78
00:04:25,160 --> 00:04:27,270
in a head is a certain number.

79
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:30,430
Actually, this bias for the
coin is irrelevant.

80
00:04:30,430 --> 00:04:33,260
Whether the coin is fair
or unfair, this

81
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,170
fact is always true.

82
00:04:35,170 --> 00:04:36,750
So indeed, it does
not depend on the

83
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:38,660
probability of the coin.

84
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:43,440
But if you're really curious
what happens when the coin is

85
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:45,820
fair, we can plug
in the numbers.

86
00:04:45,820 --> 00:04:52,320
And here, we're assuming the
coin is fair, which means

87
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,790
probability of having
a head is 1/2.

88
00:04:57,790 --> 00:05:01,130
Then, we'll see after going
through the calculations that

89
00:05:01,130 --> 00:05:05,610
the first probability is 1/2,
whereas the second probability

90
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,090
is 1/3, which means,
in this case, the

91
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:12,640
dominance actually is strict.

92
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,550
So the first one is strictly
greater than

93
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:16,110
the second one, OK?

94
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,480
So this completes the first
part of the problem.

95
00:05:18,480 --> 00:05:22,590
How do we generalize this into
more general settings?

96
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:24,300
There are multiple ways,
but we'll go over

97
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,630
one particular form.

98
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:35,880
And to do so, we'll be defining
three events somewhat

99
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,030
more abstractly.

100
00:05:37,030 --> 00:05:38,420
Let's say we have
three events--

101
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:44,530
C, D, and E. Imagine any event,
but all three events

102
00:05:44,530 --> 00:05:47,000
have to satisfy the following
condition.

103
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:54,620
First, event D will be a subset
of E. And second, the

104
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:57,950
intersection of C and
D is equal to the

105
00:05:57,950 --> 00:06:01,340
intersection of C and E, OK?

106
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:03,570
So this will be our
choice events.

107
00:06:03,570 --> 00:06:07,700
And let's see a particular
example.

108
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:12,990
Let's say you have a sample
space here and some event E.

109
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:17,570
Now, by the first condition, D
will have to lie somewhere in

110
00:06:17,570 --> 00:06:21,990
E. For the second condition,
we'll pick some event C such

111
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,500
that this is true.

112
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:27,780
And one way to do so is simply
picking C that lies within

113
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:32,630
both D and E. And you can see
C intersection D will be C.

114
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:37,910
And C intersection E will still
be C. Hence, the second

115
00:06:37,910 --> 00:06:39,760
equality is true.

116
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:42,720
So if both equalities are true,
we have the following

117
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,170
relationship, that the
probability of C conditioned

118
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,940
on D will be no smaller than
the probability of C

119
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:57,150
conditioned on event E. And this
will be the more general

120
00:06:57,150 --> 00:06:59,265
form of the inequality
that we saw before.

121
00:06:59,265 --> 00:07:01,940

122
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:03,430
So first of all, the
way to prove this

123
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:04,590
is in fact the same.

124
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:07,920
We simply write out the
value of this using

125
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,410
the fractional form.

126
00:07:09,410 --> 00:07:12,180
And based on these two facts,
we can arrive at this

127
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:15,000
equation, which I shall
now go over.

128
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,380
But just to see why this form
is more general, in fact, if

129
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:25,950
we, say, we let C be the event
A intersection B, D be the

130
00:07:25,950 --> 00:07:30,650
event A, and E be the
event A [union]

131
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:37,990
B where A and B are the events
that we defined earlier.

132
00:07:37,990 --> 00:07:41,260
We can verify that, indeed,
these conditions are true,

133
00:07:41,260 --> 00:07:45,170
namely D is a subset of E.
Because A is a subset of A

134
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:50,870
union B, and C is a subset of
both D and E. And hence,

135
00:07:50,870 --> 00:07:53,030
condition two is also true.

136
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:56,330
And if that's the case, we
will actually recover the

137
00:07:56,330 --> 00:08:00,440
result we got earlier for events
A and B. And hence,

138
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:03,710
this equation here is
a more general form.

139
00:08:03,710 --> 00:08:04,870
So that's the end
of the problem.

140
00:08:04,870 --> 00:08:06,120
See you next time.

141
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,834
