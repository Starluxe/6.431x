1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,590

2
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:03,420
Previously, we learned the
concept of independent

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,890
experiments.

4
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:08,119
In this exercise, we'll see how
the seemingly simple idea

5
00:00:08,119 --> 00:00:11,080
of independence can help us
understand the behavior of

6
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:13,240
quite complex systems.

7
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:15,720
In particular, we'll combine
the concept of independence

8
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:19,430
with the idea of divide and
conquer, where we break a

9
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:22,630
large system into smaller
components, and then use

10
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:23,260
[independence]

11
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:26,310
properties to glue them
back together.

12
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:27,740
Now, let's take a look
at the problem.

13
00:00:27,740 --> 00:00:30,950
We are given a network of
connected components, and each

14
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:32,299
component can be good with

15
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:35,680
probability p or bad otherwise.

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,370
All components are independent
from each other.

17
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:41,620
We say the system is operational
if there exists a

18
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:47,620
path connecting point A here to
point B that goes through

19
00:00:47,620 --> 00:00:49,690
only the good components.

20
00:00:49,690 --> 00:00:52,450
And we'd like to understand,
what is the probability that

21
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:54,490
system is operational?

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:01,794
Which we'll denote
by P of A to B.

23
00:01:01,794 --> 00:01:04,150
Although the problem might seem
a little complicated at

24
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:05,920
the beginning, it turns
out only two

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,420
structures really matter.

26
00:01:07,420 --> 00:01:10,800
So let's look at each of them.

27
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:14,320
In the first structure, which we
call the serial structure,

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,640
we have a collection of k
components, each one having

29
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,290
probability p of being good,
connected one next to each

30
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:24,230
other in a serial line.

31
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,770
Now, in this structure, in order
for there to be a good

32
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:29,500
path from a to b, every
single one of the

33
00:01:29,500 --> 00:01:31,380
components must be working.

34
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,380
So the probability of having
a good path from a to b is

35
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:41,640
simply p times p, so on and so,
repeated k times, which is

36
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,940
p raised to the k power.

37
00:01:43,940 --> 00:01:46,320
Note that the reason we can
write the probability this

38
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:49,530
way, in terms of this product,
is because of the

39
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,210
independence property.

40
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:58,720

41
00:01:58,720 --> 00:01:59,510
Now, the second useful

42
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:01,750
structure is parallel structure.

43
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:05,265
Here again, we have k components
one, two, through

44
00:02:05,265 --> 00:02:08,419
k, but this time they're
connected in parallel to each

45
00:02:08,419 --> 00:02:11,780
other, namely they start from
one point here and ends at

46
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:13,900
another point here,
and this holds for

47
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,420
every single component.

48
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:18,250
Now, for the parallel structure
to work, namely for

49
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:22,370
there to exist a good path from
a to b, it's easy to see

50
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:25,330
that as long as one of these
components works the whole

51
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:26,760
thing will work.

52
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:30,640
So the probability of a to b
is the probability that at

53
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:33,260
least one of these
components works.

54
00:02:33,260 --> 00:02:36,260
Or in [other words], the
probability of the complement

55
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:39,125
of the event where all
components fail.

56
00:02:39,125 --> 00:02:44,740
Now, if each component has
probability p to be good, then

57
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,920
the probability that all k
components fail is 1 minus p

58
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,740
raised to the kth power.

59
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,000
Again, having this expression
means that we have used the

60
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,580
property of independence,
and that is [the]

61
00:02:57,580 --> 00:03:00,990
probability of having a good
parallel structure.

62
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:02,760
Now, there's one more
observation that will be

63
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:03,800
useful for us.

64
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:07,360
Just like how we define two
components to be independent,

65
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,920
we can also find two collections
of components to

66
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,430
be independent from
each other.

67
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:16,820
For example, in this diagram,
if we call the components

68
00:03:16,820 --> 00:03:21,580
between points C and E as
collection two, and the

69
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:25,580
components between E and
B as collection three.

70
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:28,760
Now, if we assume that each
component in both

71
00:03:28,760 --> 00:03:29,570
collections--

72
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:32,210
they're completely independent
from each other, then it's not

73
00:03:32,210 --> 00:03:35,600
hard to see that collection
two and three behave

74
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,780
independently.

75
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,250
And this will be very helpful
in getting us the breakdown

76
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:45,710
from complex networks
to simpler elements.

77
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:47,630
Now, let's go back to the
original problem of

78
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:50,990
calculating the probability of
having a good path from point

79
00:03:50,990 --> 00:03:54,560
big A to point big B
in this diagram.

80
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:57,920
Based on that argument of
independent collections, we

81
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:00,070
can first divide the whole
network into three

82
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:04,870
collections, as you see here,
from A to C, C to E, and E to

83
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:09,330
B. Now, because they're
independent and in a serial

84
00:04:09,330 --> 00:04:12,180
structure, as seen by the
definition of a serial

85
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:16,140
structure here, we see that the
probability of A to B can

86
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:24,580
be written as a probability of
A to C, multiplied by C to E,

87
00:04:24,580 --> 00:04:29,230
and finally, E to B.

88
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,880
Now, the probability of A to
C is simply p because the

89
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:36,510
collection contains
only one element.

90
00:04:36,510 --> 00:04:41,090
And similarly, the probability
of E to B is not that hard

91
00:04:41,090 --> 00:04:43,070
knowing the parallel
structure here.

92
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:47,010
We see that collection three
has two components in

93
00:04:47,010 --> 00:04:53,500
parallel, so this probability
will be given by 1 minus 1

94
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,945
minus P squared.

95
00:04:55,945 --> 00:04:59,480

96
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:02,930
And it remains to calculate just
the probability of having

97
00:05:02,930 --> 00:05:07,670
a good path from point
C to point E. To get

98
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,650
a value for P [of]

99
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:16,710
C to E, we notice again, that
this area can be treated as

100
00:05:16,710 --> 00:05:24,260
two components, C1 to E and C2
to E, connected in parallel.

101
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:27,570
And using the parallel law we
get this probability is 1

102
00:05:27,570 --> 00:05:37,930
minus 1 minus P C1 to E,
multiplied by 1 minus P C2 to

103
00:05:37,930 --> 00:05:43,010
E. Note that I'm using two
different characters, C1 and

104
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:47,760
C2, to denote the same node,
which is C. This is simply for

105
00:05:47,760 --> 00:05:51,610
making it easier to analyze
two branches where they

106
00:05:51,610 --> 00:05:53,930
actually denote the same node.

107
00:05:53,930 --> 00:06:02,600
Now P C1 to E, is another serial
connection of these

108
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:08,660
three elements here with
another component.

109
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,580
So the first three elements are
connected in parallel, and

110
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:16,580
we know the probability of that
being successful is 1

111
00:06:16,580 --> 00:06:17,236
minus p [to the power]

112
00:06:17,236 --> 00:06:22,430
3, and the last one is p.

113
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:29,570
And finally, P C2 to E. It's
just a single element

114
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,715
component with probability
of [being]

115
00:06:31,715 --> 00:06:33,760
successful being p.

116
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:37,270
At this point, there is no
longer any unknown variables,

117
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:40,460
and we have indeed obtained
exact values for all the

118
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,740
quantities that we're
interested in.

119
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:44,960
So starting from this equation,
we can plug in the

120
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:51,290
values for P C2 to E, P C1 to E
back here, and then further

121
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,520
plug in P C to E back here.

122
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,880
That will give us the final
solution, which is given by

123
00:06:57,880 --> 00:07:01,370
the following somewhat
complicated formula.

124
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,240
So in summary, in this problem,
we learned how to use

125
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:07,820
the independence property among
different components to

126
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,850
break down the entire fairly
complex network into simple

127
00:07:11,850 --> 00:07:15,570
modular components, and use the
law of serial and parallel

128
00:07:15,570 --> 00:07:19,580
connections to put the
probabilities back together

129
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,640
and come up with the overall
success probability of finding

130
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:24,700
a path from A to B.
