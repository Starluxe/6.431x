1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,730

2
00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:03,890
In this problem, we'll be
working with a object called

3
00:00:03,890 --> 00:00:08,180
random walk, where we have a
person on the line-- or a

4
00:00:08,180 --> 00:00:10,370
tight rope, according
to the problem.

5
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:13,580
Let's start from the origin, and
each time step, it would

6
00:00:13,580 --> 00:00:16,420
randomly either go forward
or backward with certain

7
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,405
probability.

8
00:00:17,405 --> 00:00:19,860
In our case, with probability
p, the person would go

9
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:23,530
forward, and 1 minus
p going backwards.

10
00:00:23,530 --> 00:00:26,280
Now, the walk is random in the
following sense-- that the

11
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:29,780
choice going forward or backward
in each step is

12
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:31,860
random, and it's completely
independent

13
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,920
from all past history.

14
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:35,740
So let's look at the problem.

15
00:00:35,740 --> 00:00:36,830
It has three parts.

16
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:40,640
In the first part, we'd like to
know what's the probability

17
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,300
that after two steps the person
returns to the starting

18
00:00:44,300 --> 00:00:46,730
point, which in this
case is 0?

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:48,700
Now, throughout this problem,
I'm going to be using the

20
00:00:48,700 --> 00:00:50,820
following notation.

21
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,450
F indicates the action of going
forward and B indicates

22
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:57,470
the action of going backwards.

23
00:00:57,470 --> 00:01:02,290
A sequence says F and B implies
the sample that the

24
00:01:02,290 --> 00:01:05,850
person first goes forward,
and then backwards.

25
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:09,540
If I add another F, it will
mean, forward, backward,

26
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:10,690
forward again.

27
00:01:10,690 --> 00:01:11,940
OK?

28
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,520

29
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:16,910
So in order for the person to
go somewhere after two steps

30
00:01:16,910 --> 00:01:21,220
and return to the origin, the
following must happen.

31
00:01:21,220 --> 00:01:26,030
Either the person went forward
followed by backward, or

32
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:29,270
backward followed by forward.

33
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:32,290
And indeed, this event--

34
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:35,050
namely, the union of these
two possibilities--

35
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:39,930
defines the event of interest
in our case.

36
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,970
And we'd like to know what's
the probability of A, which

37
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:48,410
we'll break down into the
probability of forward,

38
00:01:48,410 --> 00:01:52,640
backward, backward, forward.

39
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,610
Now, forward-backward and
backward-forward, they are two

40
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:57,660
completely different outcomes.

41
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:01,010
And we know that because they're
disjoint, this would

42
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:05,100
just be the sum of the
two probabilities--

43
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:08,259
plus probability of
backward-forward.

44
00:02:08,259 --> 00:02:12,920

45
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:16,090
Here's where the independence
will come in.

46
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:18,850
When we try to compute the
probability of going forward

47
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:21,280
and backward, because
the action--

48
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,360
each step is completely
independent from the past, we

49
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:27,630
know this is the same as saying,
in the first step, we

50
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,550
have probability p of going
forward, in the next step,

51
00:02:31,550 --> 00:02:34,770
probability 1 minus p
of going backwards.

52
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:38,360
We can do so-- namely, writing
the probability of forward,

53
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:42,450
backward as a product of going
forward times the probability

54
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:45,950
of going backwards, because
these actions are independent.

55
00:02:45,950 --> 00:02:49,310
And similarly, for the second
one, we have going backwards

56
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:52,980
first, times going forward
the second time.

57
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:59,280
Adding these two up, we have 2
times p times (1 minus p).

58
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,850
And that will be the answer to
the first part of the problem.

59
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,440

60
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:06,540
In the second part of the
problem, we're interested in

61
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:11,370
the probability that after three
steps, the person ends

62
00:03:11,370 --> 00:03:14,410
up in position 1, or
one step forward

63
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:16,750
compared to where he started.

64
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,610
Now, the only possibilities here
are that among the three

65
00:03:19,610 --> 00:03:23,440
steps, exactly two steps are
forward, and one step is

66
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,500
backwards, because otherwise
there's no way the person will

67
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,050
end up in position 1.

68
00:03:29,050 --> 00:03:32,980
To do so, there, again, are
three possibilities in which

69
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:36,670
we go forward, forward,
backward, or forward,

70
00:03:36,670 --> 00:03:41,690
backward, forward, or backward,
forward, forward.

71
00:03:41,690 --> 00:03:44,850
And that exhausts all the
possibilities that the person

72
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:47,490
can end up in position
1 after three steps.

73
00:03:47,490 --> 00:03:50,340
And we'll define the collection
of all these

74
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:56,440
outcomes as event C. The
probability of event C--

75
00:03:56,440 --> 00:03:57,660
same as before--

76
00:03:57,660 --> 00:03:59,930
is simply the sum of
the probability of

77
00:03:59,930 --> 00:04:02,560
each individual outcome.

78
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:05,640
Now, based on the independence
assumption that we used

79
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,770
before, each outcome here has
the same probability, which is

80
00:04:09,770 --> 00:04:14,230
equal to p squared times
(1 minus p).

81
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:17,079
The p squared comes from the
fact that two forward steps

82
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:22,790
are taken, and 1 minus p, the
probability of that one

83
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:23,440
backwards step.

84
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,910
And since there are three of
them, we multiply 3 in front,

85
00:04:27,910 --> 00:04:30,030
and that will give us
the probability.

86
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:32,130
In the last part of
the problem, we're

87
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:33,530
asked to compute --

88
00:04:33,530 --> 00:04:35,630
conditional on event C already
[having taken]

89
00:04:35,630 --> 00:04:36,480
place --

90
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,250
what is the probability that the
first step he took was a

91
00:04:40,250 --> 00:04:41,580
forward step?

92
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:43,943
Without going into the details,
let's take a look at

93
00:04:43,943 --> 00:04:47,840
C, in which we have three
elements, and only the first

94
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,440
two elements correspond
to a forward step

95
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:54,500
in the first step.

96
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:58,490
So we can define event
D as simply

97
00:04:58,490 --> 00:05:00,100
the first two outcomes--

98
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:02,580
forward, forward, backward, and

99
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:06,170
forward, backward, forward.

100
00:05:06,170 --> 00:05:09,910
Now, the probability we're
interested in is simply

101
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:15,540
probability of D conditional on
C. We'd write it out using

102
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:15,960
the [definition]

103
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,950
of conditional probability--

104
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:22,810
D intersection C conditional
on C. Now, because D is a

105
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:27,270
subset of C, we have probability
of D divided by

106
00:05:27,270 --> 00:05:29,510
the probability of C.

107
00:05:29,510 --> 00:05:33,380
Again, because all samples
here have the same

108
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:37,290
probability, all we need to do
is to count the number of

109
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:40,190
samples here, which is 2, and
divide by the number of

110
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,130
samples here, which is 3.

111
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:47,020
So we end up with 2 over 3.

112
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:48,940
And that concludes
the problem.

113
00:05:48,940 --> 00:05:50,190
See you next time.

114
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:51,367
