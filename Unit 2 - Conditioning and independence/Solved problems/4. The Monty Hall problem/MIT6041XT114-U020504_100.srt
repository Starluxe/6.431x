00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,433

2
00:00:00,433 --> 00:00:01,300
Hi.

3
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:02,780
In the session, we'll
be solving

4
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:04,500
the Monty Hall problem.

5
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:07,190
And this problem is based on
an old game show that was

6
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:09,930
called "Let's Make a Deal."
And the host of this game

7
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:13,170
show, his name was Monty Hall,
which is why this problem is

8
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:15,570
now known as the Monty
Hall problem.

9
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:18,840
And this problem is actually
pretty well-known, because

10
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,450
there was some disagreement at
the time over what the right

11
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:24,330
answer to this problem
should be.

12
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,800
Even some really smart people
didn't agree on what the right

13
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:29,360
answer should be.

14
00:00:29,360 --> 00:00:36,040
And part of what might explain
that disagreement is that they

15
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:38,110
probably were considering
slightly different variations

16
00:00:38,110 --> 00:00:43,220
of the problem, because as in
all probability problems, the

17
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:44,930
assumptions that you're
working with are very

18
00:00:44,930 --> 00:00:48,860
important, because otherwise you
may be solving an actually

19
00:00:48,860 --> 00:00:50,080
different problem.

20
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:54,480
And so what we'll do first is
really layout concretely what

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,760
all the assumptions are, what
the rules of the game are.

22
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:00,190
And then we'll go through the
methodology to solve for the

23
00:01:00,190 --> 00:01:02,350
actual answer.

24
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:07,530
So the game is actually
relatively simple.

25
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,820
So you're on a game
show and you're

26
00:01:10,820 --> 00:01:12,490
presented with three doors.

27
00:01:12,490 --> 00:01:13,720
These doors are closed.

28
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:17,940
And behind one of these doors is
a prize, let's say, a car.

29
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:20,840
And behind the other two
doors, there's nothing.

30
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:22,790
You don't know which
one it is.

31
00:01:22,790 --> 00:01:26,170
And the rules of the game are
that, first, you get to choose

32
00:01:26,170 --> 00:01:27,800
any one of these three.

33
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:31,820
So you pick one of the
doors that you want.

34
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:35,620
They don't show you what's
behind that door, but your

35
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:38,890
friend, who actually knows
which door has the prize

36
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:41,630
behind it, will look at
the remaining doors.

37
00:01:41,630 --> 00:01:45,640
So let's, just for example,
let's say you chose door one.

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:48,900
Your friend will look at
the other two doors

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:51,240
and open one of them.

40
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:53,370
And you will make sure
that the one

41
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:54,950
that he opens is empty.

42
00:01:54,950 --> 00:01:57,390
That is the prize not
behind that one.

43
00:01:57,390 --> 00:02:01,810
And at this point, one of the
doors is open and its empty,

44
00:02:01,810 --> 00:02:05,130
you have your original door plus
another unopened door.

45
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:07,360
And you're given an option--
you could either stay with

46
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,789
your initial choice or
you can switch to the

47
00:02:10,789 --> 00:02:12,150
other unopened door.

48
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,780
And whichever one is your
final choice, they

49
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:15,830
will open that door.

50
00:02:15,830 --> 00:02:18,275
And if there's a price behind
it, you win, and if there is

51
00:02:18,275 --> 00:02:20,890
not, then you don't win.

52
00:02:20,890 --> 00:02:23,630
So the question that we're
trying to answer is what is

53
00:02:23,630 --> 00:02:25,290
the better strategy here?

54
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:29,790
Is the better strategy to stay
with your initial choice or is

55
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:33,910
it better to switch to the
other unopened door?

56
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,360
OK, so it turns out that the
specific rules here actually

57
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:39,600
are very important.

58
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,010
Specifically, the rule about
how your friend chooses to

59
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:43,750
open doors.

60
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:47,460
And the fact that he will always
open one of the two

61
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,650
other door that you haven't
picked and he will make sure

62
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:53,000
that that door doesn't have
a prize behind it.

63
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,930
And let's see how that actually

64
00:02:54,930 --> 00:02:56,890
plays out in this problem.

65
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:00,880
So the simplest way, I think, of
thinking about this problem

66
00:03:00,880 --> 00:03:05,050
is just to think about under
what circumstances does

67
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,900
staying with your initial
choice win?

68
00:03:07,900 --> 00:03:11,380
So if you think about it, the
only way that you can win by

69
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,450
staying with your initial choice
is if your initial

70
00:03:13,450 --> 00:03:17,270
choice happened to be the door
that has a prize behind it.

71
00:03:17,270 --> 00:03:20,820
And because you're sticking with
the initial choice, you

72
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:23,000
can actually kind of forget
about the rest of the game,

73
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,310
about opening of the other
door and about switching.

74
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:28,650
It's as if you're playing a
simpler game, which is just

75
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:33,340
you have three doors, one of
them has a prize behind it,

76
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,480
and you choose one of them.

77
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:37,340
And if you guessed right,
then you win.

78
00:03:37,340 --> 00:03:40,440
If you didn't, then
you don't win.

79
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:43,360
And because the another
important assumption is that

80
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:46,020
the prize has an equal
probability of being behind

81
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:49,500
any one of three doors so one
third, one third, one third.

82
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:53,690
Because of that, then if you
stay with your first choice,

83
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:55,980
you win only if your first
choice happened

84
00:03:55,980 --> 00:03:56,740
to the right one.

85
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:59,800
And that is the case with
probablility one third.

86
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:04,980
So with that simple argument you
can convince yourself that

87
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,400
the probability of winning,
given the strategy of staying

88
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,990
with your first choice,
is one third.

89
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,050
Now, let's think
about the other

90
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,960
strategy, which is to switch.

91
00:04:13,960 --> 00:04:18,390
So under what circumstances does
switching win for you?

92
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:23,760
Well, if your first choice
happens to be the right door,

93
00:04:23,760 --> 00:04:29,740
then switching away from that
door will always lose.

94
00:04:29,740 --> 00:04:34,670
But let's say, that happens
with probably one third.

95
00:04:34,670 --> 00:04:37,920
But the rest of the time with
probably 2/3, your first

96
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,260
choice would be wrong.

97
00:04:39,260 --> 00:04:41,250
So let's give an example here.

98
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:44,635
Let's say, the prize, which I'll
denote by happy face, is

99
00:04:44,635 --> 00:04:45,870
behind door two.

100
00:04:45,870 --> 00:04:48,090
And your first choice
was door one.

101
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:50,390
So your first choice
was wrong.

102
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:53,730
Now, your friend can open door
two, because door two has the

103
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,650
prize behind it.

104
00:04:54,650 --> 00:04:57,540
He also doesn't open the door
that you initially picked.

105
00:04:57,540 --> 00:04:59,930
So he has to open door three.

106
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:02,110
So door three is open, and now
you have an option of sticking

107
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:03,520
with your first choice--
door one--

108
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:05,330
or switching to door two.

109
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:07,030
So in this case, it's
obvious to see that

110
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,300
switching wins for you.

111
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:15,020
And now, if instead, you picked
door one first, and the

112
00:05:15,020 --> 00:05:19,300
prize was behind door three,
again, you are wrong.

113
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:22,120
And again, your friend is
forced to open door two.

114
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:24,530
And switching, again,
wins for you.

115
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:29,530
And so if you think about it,
switching will win for you, as

116
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:32,560
long as your initial
pick was wrong.

117
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:36,610
If your initial pick was wrong,
then the prize is

118
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:38,540
behind one of the doors.

119
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:41,050
Your friend has to open one of
the doors, but he can't open

120
00:05:41,050 --> 00:05:42,820
the door that has the
prize behind it.

121
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:48,030
So he has to open the other
bad door, leaving the good

122
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:49,490
door with the prize behind
it as the one that

123
00:05:49,490 --> 00:05:50,810
you can switch to.

124
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:54,020
And so by switching you will
win in this scenario.

125
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:55,730
And what is the probability
of that happening?

126
00:05:55,730 --> 00:06:00,160
Well, that happens if your
initial pick was wrong, which

127
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,110
happens with probably 2/3.

128
00:06:03,110 --> 00:06:06,520
So the final answer then, it's
pretty simple, the probability

129
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:09,526
of winning if you stay is one
third, and the probability of

130
00:06:09,526 --> 00:06:11,560
winning if you switch is 2/3.

131
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,130
And so maybe counterintuitively
the result

132
00:06:15,130 --> 00:06:17,500
is that it's actually better
for you, twice as good for

133
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:21,500
you, to switch rather
than stay.

134
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:26,930
And so that was the argument,
the kind of simple argument.

135
00:06:26,930 --> 00:06:29,630
We can also be more methodical
about this and actually list

136
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:31,020
out all of the possible
outcomes.

137
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,290
Because it's relatively small
problem-- there's only three

138
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:35,050
doors-- we can actually
just list out all

139
00:06:35,050 --> 00:06:36,230
the possible outcomes.

140
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:40,000
So for example, if you chose
door one first, and the prize

141
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,570
was behind door one, your
friend has a choice.

142
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:44,870
He can open door two or
door three, because

143
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,740
they're both empty.

144
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,440
And then in that case, if you
stay, you win, you picked the

145
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,250
door correctly.

146
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,940
And if you switch to two or
three, then you lose.

147
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:58,400
But if you chose door one, the
prize is behind door two, then

148
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:00,580
your friend has to open door
three, he is forced to do

149
00:07:00,580 --> 00:07:03,510
that, then staying with lose
but switching would win.

150
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:06,320
And so on for the other cases.

151
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:13,920
And so again, this is just an
exhaustive list of all the

152
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:17,020
possible outcomes, from which
you can see that, in fact,

153
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:22,520
staying wins, only if your
first choice was correct.

154
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:24,850
And switching wins in
all the other cases.

155
00:07:24,850 --> 00:07:28,780
And so one third of the time,
staying would win, 2/3 of the

156
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:31,070
time switching would win.

157
00:07:31,070 --> 00:07:35,210
OK, so now, we have
the answer.

158
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:37,880
Let's try to figure out and
convince yourself that it's

159
00:07:37,880 --> 00:07:40,780
actually right, because you
might think before going

160
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,870
through this process that
maybe it doesn't matter

161
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:46,410
whether you stay or you switch,
they both have the

162
00:07:46,410 --> 00:07:47,900
same probablility of
winning, or maybe

163
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,910
even staying is better.

164
00:07:49,910 --> 00:07:52,950
So why is staying worse
and switching better?

165
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:56,790
Well, the first argument really
is something that we've

166
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:58,430
already talked about.

167
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:02,750
By staying, you're essentially
banking on your first choice

168
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:06,390
being correct, which is a
relatively poor bet, because

169
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:09,350
you have only one in three
chance of being right.

170
00:08:09,350 --> 00:08:13,340
But by switching, you're
actually banking on your first

171
00:08:13,340 --> 00:08:17,600
choice being wrong, which is a
relatively better bet, because

172
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,100
you're more likely to be wrong
than right in your first

173
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,580
choice, because you're
just picking blindly.

174
00:08:22,580 --> 00:08:27,120
OK, so that is one intuitive
explanation for why

175
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:29,620
switching is better.

176
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:34,320
Another slightly different way
to think about it is that

177
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,960
instead of picking single doors,
you're actually picking

178
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:41,770
groups of doors.

179
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:44,780
So let's say that your first
pick was door one.

180
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:49,510
Then you're actually really
deciding between door one or

181
00:08:49,510 --> 00:08:52,120
doors two and three combined.

182
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:53,365
So why is that?

183
00:08:53,365 --> 00:08:56,560
It's because by staying
with door one, you're

184
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:57,950
staying with door one.

185
00:08:57,950 --> 00:09:02,360
But by switching, you're
actually getting two doors for

186
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,460
the price of one, because you
know that your friend will

187
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:11,170
reveal one of these to be empty,
and the other one will

188
00:09:11,170 --> 00:09:11,950
stay closed.

189
00:09:11,950 --> 00:09:16,010
But switching really kind of
buys you both of these.

190
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:21,640
And so because it buys you two
opportunities to win, you get

191
00:09:21,640 --> 00:09:24,210
2/3 chance of winning, versus
a one third chance.

192
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:26,930

193
00:09:26,930 --> 00:09:30,920
Another way of thinking about
this is to increase the scale

194
00:09:30,920 --> 00:09:37,570
of the problem, and maybe that
will help visualize the

195
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:39,890
counter-intuitive answer.

196
00:09:39,890 --> 00:09:42,710
So instead of having three
doors, imagine that you have

197
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:45,890
1,000 doors that are closed.

198
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:51,230
And again, one prize is behind
one of the doors.

199
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,510
And the rules are similar-- you
pick one door first, and

200
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:59,720
then your friend will open
998 other doors.

201
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,370
And these doors are guaranteed
to be empty.

202
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:05,450
And now you're left with your
initial door plus one other

203
00:10:05,450 --> 00:10:07,140
door that is unopened.

204
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:09,590
So now the question is should
you stay with your first

205
00:10:09,590 --> 00:10:14,540
choice or switch to
your other choice?

206
00:10:14,540 --> 00:10:18,940
And it should be more
intuitively obvious now that

207
00:10:18,940 --> 00:10:21,890
the better decision would be
to switch, because you're

208
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:27,450
overwhelmingly more likely to
have picked incorrectly for

209
00:10:27,450 --> 00:10:28,250
your first pick.

210
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:31,000
You have only 1 in 1,000 chance
of getting it right.

211
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:36,240
So that is kind of just taking
this to a bigger extreme and

212
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:40,020
really driving home
the intuition.

213
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:50,110
OK, so what we've really
discovered is that the fact

214
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:53,430
that the rules of the game are
that your friend has to open

215
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:57,840
one of the other two doors and
cannot reveal the prize plays

216
00:10:57,840 --> 00:10:59,580
a big role in this problem.

217
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,770
And that is an important
assumption.

218
00:11:01,770 --> 00:11:04,720
OK, so now let's think
about a slightly

219
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:05,980
different variation now.

220
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,990
So a different strategy.

221
00:11:06,990 --> 00:11:10,550
Instead of just always staying
or always switching, we have a

222
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:15,540
specific other strategy, which
is that you will choose door

223
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:19,550
one first and then, depending on
what your friend does, you

224
00:11:19,550 --> 00:11:21,680
will act accordingly.

225
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,620
So if your friend opens door
two, you will not switch.

226
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:28,130
And if your friend opens door
three, you will switch.

227
00:11:28,130 --> 00:11:33,150
So let's draw out exactly
what happens here.

228
00:11:33,150 --> 00:11:35,160
So you have door one
that you've chosen.

229
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:37,980

230
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:42,780
And the prize can be behind
doors one, two, or three.

231
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:44,590
And again, it's equally
likely.

232
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,450
So the probabilities of these
branches are one third, one

233
00:11:47,450 --> 00:11:50,220
third, and one third.

234
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:57,970
And now given that, your friend
in this scenario has a

235
00:11:57,970 --> 00:12:00,130
choice between opening
doors two or three.

236
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:03,510
And so because of doors, you
chose one, the prize actually

237
00:12:03,510 --> 00:12:06,400
is behind one, and so two and
three are both empty, so he

238
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:08,030
can choose whichever one
he wants to open.

239
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:11,380

240
00:12:11,380 --> 00:12:15,490
And the problem actually hasn't
specified how your

241
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:16,660
friend actually decides
between this.

242
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:21,310
So we'll leave it in general.

243
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:22,900
So we'll say that [with]

244
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:26,000
probability p, your friend
will open two, door

245
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:26,670
two, in this case.

246
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:31,480
And with the remaining
probability 1 minus p, he will

247
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,270
open door three.

248
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,340
What about in this case?

249
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,760
Well, you chose door one.

250
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,490
The prize is actually
behind door two.

251
00:12:37,490 --> 00:12:40,010
So following the rules of the
game, your friend is forced to

252
00:12:40,010 --> 00:12:40,920
open door three.

253
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:43,530
So this happens with
probability 1.

254
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,710
And similarly, if the prize is
behind door three, your friend

255
00:12:46,710 --> 00:12:48,890
is forced to open door two,
which, again, happens with

256
00:12:48,890 --> 00:12:50,460
probably 1.

257
00:12:50,460 --> 00:12:53,860
So now let's see how this
strategy works.

258
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:55,300
When do you win?

259
00:12:55,300 --> 00:13:02,300
You win when, according to the
strategy, your final choice is

260
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:02,900
the right door.

261
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:06,160
So according to the strategy,
in this case, your friend

262
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:07,650
opened door two.

263
00:13:07,650 --> 00:13:10,560
And according to your strategy,
if door two is open,

264
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:11,330
you don't switch.

265
00:13:11,330 --> 00:13:13,660
So you stay with your
first choice of one.

266
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:17,380
And that happens to the right
one, so you win in this case.

267
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,500
But what about here?

268
00:13:18,500 --> 00:13:22,110
Your friend opened door three,
and by your strategy, you do

269
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:26,080
switch, which is the wrong
choice here, so you lose.

270
00:13:26,080 --> 00:13:28,750
Here, you switch, because you
open door three, and you

271
00:13:28,750 --> 00:13:31,460
switch to the right door,
so that wins.

272
00:13:31,460 --> 00:13:34,910
And this one, you don't
switch, and you lose.

273
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:39,110
All right, so what is the final
probability of winning?

274
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:42,130
And the final probably of
winning is the probability of

275
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,730
getting to these two outcomes,
which happens with probability

276
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:52,510
one third times p plus
one third times 1.

277
00:13:52,510 --> 00:13:53,670
So one third.

278
00:13:53,670 --> 00:13:57,010
So the final answer
is 1/3 p plus 1/3.

279
00:13:57,010 --> 00:14:00,520
And notice now that the answer
isn't just a number.

280
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:04,400
Like in this case, the answer
was one third and 2/3.

281
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,930
And it didn't actually matter
how your friend chose between

282
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,220
these two doors when
he had a choice.

283
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:12,680
But in this case, it actually
doesn't matter, because p

284
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,090
stays in the answer.

285
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:17,420
But one thing that we can do
is we can compare this with

286
00:14:17,420 --> 00:14:18,780
these strategies.

287
00:14:18,780 --> 00:14:22,470
So what we see is that, well, p
is a probability, so it has

288
00:14:22,470 --> 00:14:23,920
to be between 0 and 1.

289
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,000
So this probability winning for
this strategy is somewhere

290
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:31,130
between one third times 0 plus
one third, which is one third.

291
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:33,460
And one third times 1 plus
one third, which is 2/3.

292
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:38,530
So the strategy is somewhere
between 2/3 and one third.

293
00:14:38,530 --> 00:14:43,560
So what we see is that no matter
what, this strategy is

294
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,200
at least as good as staying all
the time, because that was

295
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,060
only one third.

296
00:14:47,060 --> 00:14:51,610
And no matter what it can't be
any better than switching,

297
00:14:51,610 --> 00:14:53,850
which was 2/3.

298
00:14:53,850 --> 00:14:56,850
So you can also come up with
lots of other different

299
00:14:56,850 --> 00:15:00,970
strategies and see what the
probabilities of winning are

300
00:15:00,970 --> 00:15:02,580
in that case.

301
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:05,100
OK, so what have we learned
in this problem?

302
00:15:05,100 --> 00:15:06,380
What are the key takeaways?

303
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:10,680
One important takeaway is that
it's important to really

304
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,500
understand a problem and arrive
at a concrete and

305
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,530
precise set of assumptions.

306
00:15:15,530 --> 00:15:19,070
So really have a precise problem
that you're solving.

307
00:15:19,070 --> 00:15:24,460
And another important takeaway
is to think about your final

308
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:27,230
answer, make sure that that
actually makes sense to you,

309
00:15:27,230 --> 00:15:30,740
make sure that you can justify
it somehow intuitively.

310
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,030
In that case, you can actually
convince yourself that your

311
00:15:35,030 --> 00:15:37,890
answer is actually correct,
because sometimes go through a

312
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:41,660
lot of formulas, and sometimes
your formula may have an error

313
00:15:41,660 --> 00:15:43,040
in there somewhere.

314
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:45,040
But you could take the final
answer and ask yourself does

315
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:48,100
this actually makes sense,
intuitively?

316
00:15:48,100 --> 00:15:52,250
That's often a very good check
and sometimes you can catch

317
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:55,400
errors in your calculations
that way.

318
00:15:55,400 --> 00:15:57,160
OK so we'll see next time.

319
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:03,000
