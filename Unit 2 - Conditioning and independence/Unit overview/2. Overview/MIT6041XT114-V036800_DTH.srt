00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,340

2
00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:03,360
In the first lecture, we
introduced probabilities as a

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,840
way of describing our beliefs
about the likelihood that a

4
00:00:06,840 --> 00:00:08,860
given event will occur.

5
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:11,440
But our beliefs will in
general depend on the

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,530
information that we have.

7
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,000
Taking into account new
information leads us to

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,990
consider so-called conditional
probabilities.

9
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:22,790
These are revised probabilities
that take into

10
00:00:22,790 --> 00:00:25,720
account the new information.

11
00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:29,090
Conditional probabilities are
very useful whenever we want

12
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:32,830
to break up a model into simpler
pieces using a divide

13
00:00:32,830 --> 00:00:34,550
and conquer strategy.

14
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:37,940
This is done using certain tools
that we will develop and

15
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:40,870
which we will keep applying
throughout this course in

16
00:00:40,870 --> 00:00:42,540
different guises.

17
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:45,990
They are also the foundation
of the field of inference.

18
00:00:45,990 --> 00:00:49,970
And we will see how they
arise in that context.

19
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:53,780
Then, in the second lecture of
this unit, we will consider a

20
00:00:53,780 --> 00:00:57,860
special case where one event
does not convey useful

21
00:00:57,860 --> 00:01:01,160
information about another,
a situation that we call

22
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:03,730
independence.

23
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:05,920
Independence usually describes
a situation where the

24
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,360
occurrence or non-occurrence
of different events is

25
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,170
determined by factors that
are completely unrelated.

26
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:17,030
Independence is what allows us
to build complex models out of

27
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:18,420
simple ones.

28
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:21,640
This is because it is often the
case that a complex system

29
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:24,640
is made up of several components
that are affected

30
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,400
by unrelated, that is,
independent sources of

31
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:29,960
randomness.

32
00:01:29,960 --> 00:01:33,300
And so with the tools to be
developed in this unit, we

33
00:01:33,300 --> 00:01:36,180
will be ready to calculate
probabilities in fairly

34
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:37,790
complex probabilistic models.

35
00:01:37,790 --> 00:01:39,040
