00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,450


2
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,450
You build a local communication
network consisting

3
00:00:08,450 --> 00:00:12,650
of routers, computers,
and some hard-wired links

4
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:14,520
that connect them.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:17,120
However, its link has
a small probability

6
00:00:17,120 --> 00:00:21,770
of being nonfunctional
because of a hardware failure.

7
00:00:21,770 --> 00:00:23,990
Assuming that failures
at different lengths

8
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:27,050
happen independently,
how likely is it

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:30,560
that the message from
router A will still

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,980
be able to reach your computer?

11
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:37,040
Suppose now that you received
notice that one of the routers

12
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,360
is down.

13
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:40,550
Given this information,
how would you

14
00:00:40,550 --> 00:00:44,330
update the probability that
the message from router A

15
00:00:44,330 --> 00:00:48,890
will still be able to
reach your computer?

16
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:50,870
By the end of this
unit, you will

17
00:00:50,870 --> 00:00:53,840
be able to answer
questions of this type

18
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,140
by using the concept of
conditional probability

19
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:59,900
and by giving a precise
meaning to the concept

20
00:00:59,900 --> 00:01:02,430
of independent failures.

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:03,446
