1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,100

2
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:04,059
By this point in this class, we
have developed all of the

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:06,650
basic tools that we need
to study and analyze

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:08,540
probabilistic models.

5
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:12,130
So this is a good time to move
to a practical subject, the

6
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,260
subject of inference.

7
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:17,030
The general idea is that we
have a probabilistic model

8
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:19,400
involving several random
variables.

9
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:21,740
We observe the values
of some of them.

10
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:25,230
And we want to make inferences
on some of the others.

11
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,340
Note that the unknown quantities
are modeled as

12
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:31,020
random variables, which
means that we can

13
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:32,299
use the Bayes rule.

14
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,590
And so we will stay within
the realm of

15
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:37,930
so-called Bayesian inference.

16
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:41,070
In the four lectures that
follow, we will illustrate the

17
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:44,040
use of the Bayes rule
in various settings.

18
00:00:44,040 --> 00:00:46,730
We will discuss different
methods of coming up with

19
00:00:46,730 --> 00:00:49,620
estimates of unobserved
random variables.

20
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:51,670
And we will illustrate
the methodology

21
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,490
through several examples.

22
00:00:54,490 --> 00:00:56,990
If you have mastered the
material in previous units,

23
00:00:56,990 --> 00:00:59,530
you should not face any
challenges here.

24
00:00:59,530 --> 00:01:03,460
We will only apply tools that we
already have, together with

25
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:06,070
some new definitions
and terminology.

26
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,560
However, this may be a good time
to review the different

27
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:12,980
versions of the Bayes rule and
the examples covered in the

28
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:15,850
second half of lecture 10.

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:18,930
And by the end of this unit,
you should have a working

30
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,960
knowledge of the key elements
of Bayesian inference.

31
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,840
And you should be ready to apply
your knowledge to actual

32
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,360
problems, as they arise
in the real world.

33
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:28,610
