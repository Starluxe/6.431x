1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,990


2
00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:03,900
- The fire department
receives emergency calls

3
00:00:03,900 --> 00:00:06,550
from all over the city.

4
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:09,090
If we believe that calls
occur in a completely

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:12,180
random and
uncoordinated fashion,

6
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:16,875
how do we translate these
beliefs into a tractable model?

7
00:00:16,875 --> 00:00:19,010
Then, once we have
a model, there

8
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,980
are many questions
we may want to raise.

9
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:27,640
For example, how many calls are
expected tomorrow afternoon?

10
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:31,294
How much does this
number fluctuate?

11
00:00:31,294 --> 00:00:32,710
What is the
probability that there

12
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:34,955
are no calls within
the next three hours?

13
00:00:34,955 --> 00:00:41,290


14
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,210
The fire department
also distinguishes

15
00:00:43,210 --> 00:00:45,820
between different
types of calls,

16
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:48,460
for example, those
related to fires

17
00:00:48,460 --> 00:00:52,630
or the less serious
calls, like whenever

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:55,330
a cat is stuck on a tree.

19
00:00:55,330 --> 00:00:58,690
How do we refine our model to
account for the different types

20
00:00:58,690 --> 00:01:00,330
of calls?

21
00:01:00,330 --> 00:01:04,420
What can we say about the
number of less serious calls

22
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:07,650
before the first
call about the fire?

23
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,600
In this unit, we will
study Bernoulli processes

24
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:13,480
in discrete time and
Poisson processes

25
00:01:13,480 --> 00:01:16,510
in continuous time, which
provide the framework

26
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:21,310
for describing and analyzing all
sorts of situations involving

27
00:01:21,310 --> 00:01:25,191
a sequence of requests
or customer arrivals.

28
00:01:25,191 --> 00:01:25,691
