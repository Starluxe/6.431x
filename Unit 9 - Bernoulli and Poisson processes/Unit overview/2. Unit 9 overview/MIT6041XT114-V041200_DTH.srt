00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,900

2
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,380
In this three-lecture unit, we
introduce random processes or

3
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,600
stochastic processes as they
are sometimes called.

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,640
A random process is basically
a probabilistic phenomenon

5
00:00:12,640 --> 00:00:14,600
that evolves in time.

6
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:18,220
An example would be the motion
of a balloon in the presence

7
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:20,370
of random wind gusts.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:25,330
Another could be a sequence
of stock market prices.

9
00:00:25,330 --> 00:00:29,200
Phenomena that evolve in time
can be quite complex even in a

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:31,210
deterministic setting.

11
00:00:31,210 --> 00:00:34,470
But in this unit, we will focus
on a very simple class

12
00:00:34,470 --> 00:00:38,220
of random processes, models that
describe arrivals that

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:42,840
occur over time and that
have no memory.

14
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,930
In discrete time, this
corresponds to carrying out an

15
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:48,820
independent trial at
each time slot.

16
00:00:48,820 --> 00:00:49,800
And if the trial is

17
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:52,230
successful, we have an arrival.

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:56,250
This is the Bernoulli process.

19
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,550
In continuous time, things
are more complicated.

20
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:02,440
But we will develop a continuous
time analog of the

21
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:07,170
Bernoulli process, which is
called the Poisson process.

22
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:09,910
For the processes that we
introduce, we will study some

23
00:01:09,910 --> 00:01:12,370
questions that are of
interest for any

24
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:14,330
type of arrival process.

25
00:01:14,330 --> 00:01:17,950
For example, we will see how
we can find the probability

26
00:01:17,950 --> 00:01:22,540
that there are exactly 10
arrivals during the next hour,

27
00:01:22,540 --> 00:01:26,720
or the probability that the 10th
arrival happens within

28
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:30,630
two hours, or how to find the
distribution of the time

29
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,810
between the second and
the third arrival.

30
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:37,190
We will also go a little deeper
and consider what

31
00:01:37,190 --> 00:01:40,100
happens when we manipulate
or combine

32
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:43,690
various arrival streams.

33
00:01:43,690 --> 00:01:46,710
In some sense, all that we will
do in this unit will be

34
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,100
an application of skills
that we already have.

35
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:53,870
On the other hand, we will have
to rely heavily on an

36
00:01:53,870 --> 00:01:57,420
intuitive understanding of these
processes, which is the

37
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,340
key to solving complex
problems.

38
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,590
