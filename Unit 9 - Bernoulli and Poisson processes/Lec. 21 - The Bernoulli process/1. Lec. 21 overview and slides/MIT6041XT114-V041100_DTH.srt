00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,190

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:04,520
In this lecture, we discuss
the simplest nontrivial

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,220
stochastic process, the
Bernoulli process.

4
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,670
Time is divided into slots.

5
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:13,230
At each slot, we have
an independent trial

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:14,910
such as a coin flip.

7
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:18,070
And each trial results
in heads or tails.

8
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:22,780
Or in different language, each
trial may or may not result in

9
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:26,020
an arrival or a success.

10
00:00:26,020 --> 00:00:28,830
Pretty much everything we
will do will be a simple

11
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:31,590
application of skills that
we already have.

12
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:35,270
For example, we already know
that the number of arrivals in

13
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,720
n time slots is described
by the binomial PMF.

14
00:00:40,720 --> 00:00:43,340
We will then discuss some
consequences of the

15
00:00:43,340 --> 00:00:46,140
independence of the
different trials.

16
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:49,190
Basically, the process
has no memory.

17
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,630
Whatever happens in the future
is not affected by whatever

18
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,620
happened in the past.

19
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:58,170
By exploiting this property, we
will find the distribution

20
00:00:58,170 --> 00:01:01,725
of the time of the first arrival
and more generally of

21
00:01:01,725 --> 00:01:04,739
the time of the kth arrival.

22
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,150
We will also find the
distribution of the time

23
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:10,410
between consecutive arrivals.

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:13,440
Next, we will take two
independent Bernoulli

25
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:17,930
processes, let's say arrivals of
men and arrivals of women,

26
00:01:17,930 --> 00:01:22,280
and merge them to get an overall
arrival process.

27
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:24,690
We will see that the
merged process is

28
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:27,300
also a Bernoulli process.

29
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,260
We will also look at the reverse
operation, namely,

30
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:35,540
splitting a Bernoulli process
into two separate processes.

31
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:39,590
Finally, we will look at a
particular asymptotic regime

32
00:01:39,590 --> 00:01:43,730
in which we have a large number
of time slots but a

33
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:48,120
very small probability of an
arrival during each time slot.

34
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,950
We will carry out some algebraic
manipulations.

35
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:54,510
And we will see that the
binomial PMF for the number of

36
00:01:54,510 --> 00:01:59,080
arrivals can be well
approximated by the so-called

37
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:00,330
Poisson PMF.

38
00:02:00,330 --> 00:02:01,200
