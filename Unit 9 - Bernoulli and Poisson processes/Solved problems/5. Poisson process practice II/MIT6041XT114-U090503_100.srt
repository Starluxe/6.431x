00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,300

2
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:00,800
Hi.

3
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:03,180
In this problem, we're
going to get more practice

4
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:04,787
working with Poisson processes.

5
00:00:04,787 --> 00:00:06,370
And in particular,
we're going to look

6
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:08,860
at how to merge two
Poisson processes,

7
00:00:08,860 --> 00:00:13,380
and then think about where each
arrival in the merged process

8
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:15,120
came from.

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,370
In this problem, we
have a service station

10
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:20,450
that services jobs of two types.

11
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:24,800
Type A jobs we're told arrive
as a Poisson process with a rate

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,410
lambda A equals 3
jobs per minute.

13
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,640
Type B jobs also arrive as a
Poisson process with a rate

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,560
lambda B equals 4
jobs per minute.

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:38,230
And we're also told
that these two Poisson

16
00:00:38,230 --> 00:00:41,040
processes are independent.

17
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:46,820
Part (a) is looking for the
PMF, expectation, and variance

18
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:49,530
of the number of
total jobs that arrive

19
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:52,380
in any 3-minute interval.

20
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:55,040
Let's define a random
variable for that.

21
00:00:55,040 --> 00:01:01,910
So let's let N be the number
of total jobs in 3 minutes.

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,730

23
00:01:04,730 --> 00:01:07,400
We know that for
[a] Poisson process,

24
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:12,050
the distribution for the number
of arrivals in any given time

25
00:01:12,050 --> 00:01:16,470
interval tau is given by
a Poisson distribution.

26
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:18,750
But we have to do a little
bit more in this case

27
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:21,710
because we're looking for
the number of total jobs.

28
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:24,610
And here, we're only
given Poisson processes

29
00:01:24,610 --> 00:01:28,420
for the individual
types of jobs.

30
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:30,970
But because they're independent,
what we can do first

31
00:01:30,970 --> 00:01:34,550
is merge these two processes.

32
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:41,430
And what we'll get is a merged
process with a rate lambda

33
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:44,785
that's equal to the sum of
the two individual lambda

34
00:01:44,785 --> 00:01:51,725
A and lambda B. So what we get
is total jobs arrive at a rate

35
00:01:51,725 --> 00:01:56,390
lambda equals to 7 jobs per
minute in this merged process.

36
00:01:56,390 --> 00:02:01,180
Now, what we can do is apply
the Poisson distribution

37
00:02:01,180 --> 00:02:02,940
to this merged process.

38
00:02:02,940 --> 00:02:04,620
So in general, the
Poisson distribution

39
00:02:04,620 --> 00:02:09,479
is equal to lambda
times tau to the n times

40
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:15,620
e to the minus lambda
tau over n factorial.

41
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:19,465
In our case, lambda
we just said was 7.

42
00:02:19,465 --> 00:02:20,840
We're given that
we're interested

43
00:02:20,840 --> 00:02:24,440
in a 3-minute
interval, so tau was 3.

44
00:02:24,440 --> 00:02:28,110
So let's substitute that in and
we get lambda times tau is 21.

45
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:35,490
So we get 21 to the n times e to
the minus 21 over n factorial.

46
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,850
And we should
specify that this is

47
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:43,690
valid for n equals
0, 1, 2, and so on.

48
00:02:43,690 --> 00:02:46,410
The last part of
this part (a) asks us

49
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:50,250
for the expectation
and the variance.

50
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:54,040
We know that the expectation
of a Poisson random variable

51
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:55,980
is equal to lambda tau.

52
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,330
In this case, lambda tau is 21.

53
00:02:57,330 --> 00:03:00,680

54
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:04,320
We also know that the variance
of a Poisson distribution

55
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:06,010
is, again, equal to lambda tau.

56
00:03:06,010 --> 00:03:10,950
So the variance of n is
also equal to 21 here.

57
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:15,690
OK, in part (b), we're told that
we have a 10-minute interval

58
00:03:15,690 --> 00:03:18,740
and we know that there were
exactly 10 total jobs that

59
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,852
arrived in this
10-minute interval.

60
00:03:20,852 --> 00:03:22,810
And what we're asked to
find is the probability

61
00:03:22,810 --> 00:03:29,390
that exactly 3 of these
10 jobs were of type A.

62
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,590
So in order to do that, let's
go back to our merged process

63
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:38,660
and consider any arrival
in this merged process.

64
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:40,510
Let's say this one.

65
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:46,690
We know that the
probability that any arrival

66
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:53,910
in the merged process
came from type A

67
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:55,620
given that there
was an arrival, we

68
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,890
know that this probability is
equal to this ratio, lambda

69
00:03:58,890 --> 00:04:06,100
A over lambda A plus lambda
B. And so in this case,

70
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:08,330
we know that given
that there was

71
00:04:08,330 --> 00:04:10,640
an arrival in this
merged process,

72
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,000
so there was some job of
either type that arrived,

73
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,029
the probability that that
job was of type A is 3/7.

74
00:04:19,029 --> 00:04:20,529
And the other thing
that we can note

75
00:04:20,529 --> 00:04:23,270
is that suppose
that we consider now

76
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:25,710
another arrival in
this merged process.

77
00:04:25,710 --> 00:04:28,650
We also know that whether
or not this arrival

78
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:31,410
was of type A is independent of
whether or not this arrival is

79
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:35,731
of type A. Because of the fresh
start property of the Poisson

80
00:04:35,731 --> 00:04:36,230
process.

81
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:43,270
So after this arrival arrives,
the process starts anew.

82
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:45,900
And so what happens here
is independent of what

83
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,180
happens here.

84
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:51,680
Now, part (b),
remember, is asking us

85
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:54,470
for the probability
of exactly 3 type

86
00:04:54,470 --> 00:04:57,110
A jobs out of 10 total jobs.

87
00:04:57,110 --> 00:05:00,870
Now, we can think of this
from the lens of successes

88
00:05:00,870 --> 00:05:03,620
out of total number of trials.

89
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,690
If we view an arrival coming
from type A as a success,

90
00:05:08,690 --> 00:05:12,580
then what we're looking
for is the probability

91
00:05:12,580 --> 00:05:15,470
of 3 successes out of
a total of 10 trials.

92
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:18,040
And that sounds like a binomial.

93
00:05:18,040 --> 00:05:21,200
And so that is exactly
what we're going to do.

94
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:28,250
We want to find the probability
of 3 successes in 10 trials.

95
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:31,150

96
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:36,580
And we've just calculated that
the probability of any given

97
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:40,890
trial being a success is 3/7.

98
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:45,620
And so by using the binomial,
we know that this is equal to 10

99
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:53,835
choose 3 times 3/7 to
the third power times 4/7

100
00:05:53,835 --> 00:05:54,710
to the seventh power.

101
00:05:54,710 --> 00:05:59,220

102
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:05,270
Now, part (c) is telling
us that we started

103
00:06:05,270 --> 00:06:08,990
at-- suppose we
start at some time 0

104
00:06:08,990 --> 00:06:13,050
and we focus only on what
happens after this time.

105
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:17,310
We want to know, what is
the distribution, the PMF,

106
00:06:17,310 --> 00:06:24,820
of the number of type B arrivals
until the first type A arrival?

107
00:06:24,820 --> 00:06:28,950
Everything is relative to
after some arbitrary time 0.

108
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:33,875
So let's say-- this is
again, our merged process.

109
00:06:33,875 --> 00:06:36,250
These are the arrivals in the
merged process and each one

110
00:06:36,250 --> 00:06:40,500
can be of either
type A or type B.

111
00:06:40,500 --> 00:06:45,100
For example, say this is
where the first type A arrival

112
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:45,970
occurs.

113
00:06:45,970 --> 00:06:47,750
Well, what that
immediately tells

114
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:54,007
us is that these three prior
arrivals were all of type B.

115
00:06:54,007 --> 00:06:55,590
And so what we can
take away from this

116
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:00,150
is that once we know when the
first type A arrival occurs,

117
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,240
that tells us immediately how
many Type B arrivals there

118
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:08,500
were up to that
first type A arrival.

119
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:13,750
And this is exactly
the quantity that we're

120
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:16,650
trying to find the PMF of.

121
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,150
OK.

122
00:07:17,150 --> 00:07:20,840
And if you think about it,
what we're looking for now

123
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,890
is related to the
number of arrivals

124
00:07:24,890 --> 00:07:27,020
until the first type A arrival.

125
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:29,870
And that sounds
like a geometric.

126
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:32,930
The number of trials until the
first success, where success

127
00:07:32,930 --> 00:07:37,490
now we can think of
as a type A arrival.

128
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,210
OK, so let's define a
random variable again,

129
00:07:40,210 --> 00:07:55,180
K. K is the number of B arrivals
until the first A arrival.

130
00:07:55,180 --> 00:07:57,480
That's what we want to find.

131
00:07:57,480 --> 00:08:03,390
And the PMF of K, this
is the probability

132
00:08:03,390 --> 00:08:06,970
that there are k
arrivals, k B arrivals up

133
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:08,760
to the first A arrival.

134
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,535
And what we've just
said is that that

135
00:08:10,535 --> 00:08:16,310
is equivalent to being-- that
the first A arrival occurs

136
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:23,170
on the k plus 1-- occurs
on arrival number k plus 1.

137
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,800
So if this is arrival
number k plus 1,

138
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,340
then we know that
there were exactly

139
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:30,790
k B arrivals prior to it.

140
00:08:30,790 --> 00:08:40,539
OK, so what is the probability
that first A arrival is

141
00:08:40,539 --> 00:08:43,559
at k plus 1?

142
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:47,560

143
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,270
Well, that means that it's going
to be the geometric because we

144
00:08:54,270 --> 00:09:01,240
need k failures followed by a
success at the k plus 1 trial.

145
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,040
So we need k failures.

146
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,220
Meaning that the first
k arrivals must all

147
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:17,060
have come from type B. And we
can do a similar argument here

148
00:09:17,060 --> 00:09:20,350
to show that for any
arrival, the probability

149
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,850
that it's from type B is
just lambda B over lambda A

150
00:09:22,850 --> 00:09:25,960
plus lambda B, is 4/7.

151
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:29,090
So we need the first k of those
to be of type B. And then, we

152
00:09:29,090 --> 00:09:34,550
need the k plus 1
arrival to be of type A.

153
00:09:34,550 --> 00:09:37,840
And that's with probably 3/7.

154
00:09:37,840 --> 00:09:40,690
And so that gives us our answer.

155
00:09:40,690 --> 00:09:47,330
And this is valid for k
equals 0, 1, 2, and so on.

156
00:09:47,330 --> 00:09:50,490

157
00:09:50,490 --> 00:09:51,130
OK.

158
00:09:51,130 --> 00:09:53,580
And so in this problem,
we got some more practice

159
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:56,097
with Poisson
processes, specifically

160
00:09:56,097 --> 00:09:57,680
thinking about how
to merge processes.

161
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,810
And then, taking
the merged process

162
00:09:59,810 --> 00:10:02,860
and calculating
probabilities related

163
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:06,510
to going back to the
source, the origin,

164
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:09,880
whether it was from lambda A
or lambda-- type A or type B.

165
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,000
And we saw that there
are some connections

166
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:17,490
that we can make to the binomial
and the geometric in this case.

167
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:20,630
So I hope that was helpful
and see you next time.
