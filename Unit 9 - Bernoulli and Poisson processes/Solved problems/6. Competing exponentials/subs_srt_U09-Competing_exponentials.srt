00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

2
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,070
Hi.

3
00:00:01,070 --> 00:00:04,370
In this problem, we're going to
look at competing exponentials.

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:07,030
So, we have three
exponential random variables.

5
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:11,160
X with parameter lambda,
Y with parameter mu,

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:13,370
and Z with parameter nu.

7
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,765
And we want to calculate
some probability.

8
00:00:16,765 --> 00:00:18,640
And the probability that
we want to calculate

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:25,440
is the probability that X is
less than Y is less than Z.

10
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:31,910
Now, we can reinterpret this
as three Poisson processes,

11
00:00:31,910 --> 00:00:34,460
because the link
between exponentials

12
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:37,550
and Poisson processes is
that the interarrival time

13
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:40,460
of Poisson processes are
exponentially distributed.

14
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,370
So, you can think of X being
the time until the first arrival

15
00:00:45,370 --> 00:00:49,030
in a Poisson process
with parameter lambda.

16
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:52,505
And same thing for Y is
the first arrival time

17
00:00:52,505 --> 00:00:54,700
of a Poisson process
with parameter mu.

18
00:00:54,700 --> 00:00:57,120
The same thing for Z and nu.

19
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,690
So, in that interpretation,
X less than Y lesson Z,

20
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:06,690
you could interpret as a race,
meaning that X finishes first,

21
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:10,160
followed by a Y, and
then Z comes in last.

22
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:11,910
So, with that
interpretation, let's see

23
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:14,910
how we can calculate
what this probability is.

24
00:01:14,910 --> 00:01:22,480
We can rewrite this
probability as a combination

25
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:23,670
of two things occurring.

26
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:33,020
One is that X is less than
the minimum of Y and Z,

27
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:38,310
and then the other is
that Y is less than Z.

28
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,130
So, what does this
first event mean?

29
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:43,260
This first event means
that X comes in first.

30
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:45,770
And it doesn't matter
whether Y comes

31
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:47,790
in second or Z comes in second.

32
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:51,200
So, we first say that X
has to come in first, which

33
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,440
means it has to beat
the better [of] Y and Z.

34
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,720
And then that combined with
the fact that Y does better

35
00:01:59,720 --> 00:02:03,300
than Z is the same thing
as saying that X is first,

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,920
Y is second, and Z is third.

37
00:02:05,920 --> 00:02:09,580
And now let's try to argue
using Poisson processes

38
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:12,570
that these two events
are actually independent.

39
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:21,100
So, this event occurring means
that X is smaller than Y and Z.

40
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,570
So, let's take these
Poisson processes

41
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:26,590
and, because these
random variables

42
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:29,440
are assumed to be
independent, these

43
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,060
are independent Poisson
process, so, we can merge them.

44
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,100
So let's merge
these two and we'll

45
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:43,920
get a Poisson process
that has rate mu plus nu.

46
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,110
And we can also merge this
first one and that one,

47
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,720
and we'll get another
Poisson process

48
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:58,520
with parameter lambda
plus mu plus nu.

49
00:02:58,520 --> 00:03:00,480
So, in that context,
what does it

50
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,520
mean that X is less than
the minimum of Y and Z?

51
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:09,220
It just means that, in
this merged process,

52
00:03:09,220 --> 00:03:16,770
the first arrival came
from the X process.

53
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:18,850
In that case, if
that's true, then X

54
00:03:18,850 --> 00:03:21,470
is less than the
minimum of Y and Z.

55
00:03:21,470 --> 00:03:24,290
Well, let's say
that that event does

56
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:29,710
occur, that the first arrival
is from the X process.

57
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:35,970
Now we're interested in what
the order of the second two

58
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:36,570
arrivals are.

59
00:03:36,570 --> 00:03:39,450
Is it Y first and then
Z, or Z first and then Y?

60
00:03:39,450 --> 00:03:42,550
Well, it doesn't matter because
of the fresh start property.

61
00:03:42,550 --> 00:03:46,030
Because, after this
arrival comes-- and say

62
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,300
it is from the X process-- the
Poisson processes start anew,

63
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,610
and they're still independent.

64
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,820
And so what happens
after that is

65
00:03:56,820 --> 00:04:00,510
independent of what happened
here when X arrived.

66
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:05,750
Whether Y came first followed by
Z or Z came first followed by Y

67
00:04:05,750 --> 00:04:07,760
is independent of
what happened here.

68
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,260
So, because of that, these
two events are independent.

69
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:13,940
When we have the probability
of the intersection of two

70
00:04:13,940 --> 00:04:15,700
independent events,
we can write that

71
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:18,745
as the product of those
two probabilities.

72
00:04:18,745 --> 00:04:30,150

73
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:34,070
Now, what is the probability
of this first event,

74
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:36,500
the probability that X is
less than the minimum Y and Z?

75
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,400
Well, we just said
that that corresponds

76
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:41,030
to the first arrival
of this merged process

77
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:44,450
being from the X process.

78
00:04:44,450 --> 00:04:51,940
Well, that probability is lambda
over lambda plus mu plus nu.

79
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:55,000
So, it's equal to
this ratio where

80
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,950
the process that you're
interested in, its rate

81
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:01,334
comes in the numerator,
and then the merged rate

82
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:02,250
is on the denominator.

83
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:05,290

84
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,590
And what about the second one?

85
00:05:06,590 --> 00:05:10,150
What's the probably
that Y is less than Z?

86
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:13,000
Well, let's go now to
this merged process

87
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,610
where we merge just
the Y and Z processes

88
00:05:15,610 --> 00:05:17,260
and see which one comes first.

89
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:18,940
Well, in that case,
what we want to know

90
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:23,340
is, in this merged process,
what is the probability

91
00:05:23,340 --> 00:05:26,320
that the first arrival
came from the Y process.

92
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:28,700
Well, analogously,
that probability

93
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:35,120
is going to be mu
over mu plus nu,

94
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,550
and that gives us our answer.

95
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,390
And so we see that what
looked like a pretty complex

96
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,560
calculation, when
we reinterpret it

97
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,250
in terms of Poisson
processes, it

98
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:49,620
becomes relatively
easy to solve.

99
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:53,361
But this still seems like
a complicated expression,

100
00:05:53,361 --> 00:05:55,360
so let's try to check to
see whether it actually

101
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,340
makes sense.

102
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:58,860
One way to do that is to
look at a specific example

103
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:01,012
of the choice of
lambda, mu, and nu,

104
00:06:01,012 --> 00:06:02,470
and see if it
actually makes sense.

105
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:06,600

106
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:10,530
One example is, suppose that
all three of these parameters

107
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:11,930
are the same.

108
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:14,150
Well, if they're all the
same, then this probability,

109
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:22,530
the first part becomes 1/3,
and the second one is 1/2.

110
00:06:22,530 --> 00:06:25,855
And so, if all three
parameters are the same,

111
00:06:25,855 --> 00:06:28,040
the probability becomes 1/6.

112
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:30,070
And let's see if
that makes sense.

113
00:06:30,070 --> 00:06:31,990
If all three parameters
are the same,

114
00:06:31,990 --> 00:06:38,620
that means that these arrival
rates are all the same.

115
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:45,190
And what that means is that
any ordering of these three

116
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:47,990
arrivals is as likely
as any other ordering.

117
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,370
And what we're interested
in is the probability

118
00:06:50,370 --> 00:06:54,310
of one particular ordering
happening, which is X first,

119
00:06:54,310 --> 00:06:57,890
then Y, then Z. But, if
everything is symmetric,

120
00:06:57,890 --> 00:07:01,310
then any of the orderings is
as likely as any other one.

121
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,870
And how many
orderings are there?

122
00:07:02,870 --> 00:07:07,170
Well, there's three choices for
who comes in first, two for who

123
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:10,040
comes in second, and one
for who comes in last.

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,080
So, there's a total
of six possible orders

125
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:14,940
in which these three
contestants, if you think

126
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:17,362
of it that way, can
finish this race.

127
00:07:17,362 --> 00:07:19,070
And out of those, we
want the probability

128
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:21,510
that one of those
outcomes happens.

129
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,370
And so, the probability
should be 1/6,

130
00:07:23,370 --> 00:07:25,500
and that's what our
formula tells us.

131
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:28,510
So, as I said, in
this problem, we

132
00:07:28,510 --> 00:07:31,540
saw how to reinterpret
exponentials

133
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:33,630
in the context of
Poisson processes

134
00:07:33,630 --> 00:07:37,030
that helped us solve
a probability that

135
00:07:37,030 --> 00:07:38,760
looked like it was
pretty complicated.

136
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:41,461
So, I hope that was helpful,
and see you next time.

137
00:07:41,461 --> 00:07:41,960
