00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,060

00:00:02,060 --> 00:00:03,580
Hi, everyone.

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,300
Today, I'm gonna talk about
Bernoulli process, practice

4
00:00:06,300 --> 00:00:07,730
number two.

5
00:00:07,730 --> 00:00:09,990
In this problem, we
have a computer system

6
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:13,560
that carries out tasks
submitted by two users.

7
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:17,670
In this problem, time
is divided into slots.

8
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:21,270
At any slot, the probability
that the system is idle

9
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,230
is equal to 1/6.

10
00:00:23,230 --> 00:00:28,430
And the probability that the
system is busy is equal to 5/6.

11
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:31,030
During any busy
slots, the probability

12
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:35,600
that the task is submitted
by user one is equal to 2/5,

13
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,800
and the probability that the
task is submitted by user two

14
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,280
is equal to 3/5.

15
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,140
We are assuming events
related to different slots

16
00:00:44,140 --> 00:00:47,400
are all independent.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:49,730
The answers to the
questions in this problem

18
00:00:49,730 --> 00:00:53,730
can be found by considering
suitable Bernoulli processes.

19
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:55,500
Depending on a
specific question,

20
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:58,510
a different Bernoulli
process may be suitable.

21
00:00:58,510 --> 00:01:00,820
For example, for
some of the cases,

22
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:05,640
we associate trials with slots,
and in some of the other cases,

23
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,570
we associate trials
with busy slots.

24
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,880
For part (a) of the
problem, we have

25
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,860
to find the probability that
a user one task is executed

26
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:18,910
for the first time
during the fourth slot.

27
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:20,880
Because the events
from different slots

28
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,230
are all independent,
tasks from user one

29
00:01:24,230 --> 00:01:26,450
form a Bernoulli process.

30
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:29,890
The parameter of this process
represents the probability

31
00:01:29,890 --> 00:01:35,100
that a task is from user
one during each slot.

32
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:39,890
That is, the parameter of p1
is equal to the probability

33
00:01:39,890 --> 00:01:54,575
that a task is from user
one, during each slot.

34
00:01:54,575 --> 00:01:58,390

35
00:01:58,390 --> 00:02:01,120
And this is equal
to the probability

36
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:05,470
that a system is busy
during each slot, multiplied

37
00:02:05,470 --> 00:02:09,289
by the probability that
the task is from user one,

38
00:02:09,289 --> 00:02:12,180
given that the system is busy.

39
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:26,960
And this is equal to 5/6
times 2/5, which gives us 1/3.

40
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:30,500
And then, using the formulas
for [the] Bernoulli process,

41
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,600
we can calculate the
desired probability,

42
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:42,820
which is the probability
that the first user one

43
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:52,565
task occurs in slot four.

44
00:02:52,565 --> 00:02:56,740

45
00:02:56,740 --> 00:03:03,360
And this is equal to 1
minus p1, to the power of 3,

46
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:12,500
times p1, which is equal to 2/3,
to the power of 3 times 1/3.

47
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:15,880

48
00:03:15,880 --> 00:03:17,960
For part (b) of
the problem, we're

49
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:20,590
considering the first 12 slots.

50
00:03:20,590 --> 00:03:24,330
We were given that,
among the first 10 slots,

51
00:03:24,330 --> 00:03:26,890
exactly five of them were idle.

52
00:03:26,890 --> 00:03:28,490
And we need to find
the probability

53
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:32,480
that the sixth idle
slot is slot 12, given

54
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,170
that five out of the
first 10 slots were idle.

55
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,040
Because events that happen
during different slots

56
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,880
are all independent,
this probability

57
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:46,510
is equivalent to the
probability that slot 11 is busy

58
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:48,900
and slot 12 is idle.

59
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,950
And this is equal
to the probability

60
00:03:51,950 --> 00:04:02,370
that slot 11 is busy,
multiplied by the probability

61
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:05,485
that slot 12 is idle.

62
00:04:05,485 --> 00:04:08,850

63
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:11,100
Because events happening
during different slots

64
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:12,890
are independent.

65
00:04:12,890 --> 00:04:24,880
And this is equal to pb times
pi, which is equal to 5/6 times

66
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,196
1/6, which gives us 5/36.

67
00:04:28,196 --> 00:04:31,860

68
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:34,160
For part (c) of the
problem, we have

69
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:36,940
to find the expected value
of the number of slots

70
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:40,410
until the fifth
task from user one.

71
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:43,640
Let us define K as the
random variable representing

72
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:47,560
the number of slots until
the fifth task from user one.

73
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,530
Recall from part
(a) of the problem

74
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:53,320
that tasks from user one
form a Bernoulli process

75
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,720
with parameter p1, where p1
represents the probability

76
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,090
that a task is from user
one during each slot.

77
00:05:02,090 --> 00:05:07,030
Therefore, K is a Pascal random
variable, whose distribution

78
00:05:07,030 --> 00:05:09,520
looks like the following.

79
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:19,550
Probability of K equal to
t is equal to t minus 1,

80
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:29,870
choose 5 minus 1, times p1
to the power of 5, times 1

81
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:35,310
minus p1, to the
power of t minus 5,

82
00:05:35,310 --> 00:05:43,190
for all t equal to
5, 6, 7, and all.

83
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:46,710
And for all t less than
5, the probabilities

84
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,080
are all equal to 0.

85
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:52,900
Therefore, using the formula for
the expected value of a Pascal

86
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:56,070
random variable, we can
calculate the expected value

87
00:05:56,070 --> 00:06:03,430
for K, which is--
expected value of K

88
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:13,640
is equal to 5 over p1, which
is equal to 5 over 1/3,

89
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:16,860
which is equal to 15.

90
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:19,850
Therefore, the expected
value for the number

91
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:24,860
of slots until the fifth task
from user one is equal to 15.

92
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:27,190
In part (d) of the
problem, we have

93
00:06:27,190 --> 00:06:31,230
to calculate the expected value
of the number of busy slots

94
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:33,890
until the fifth
task from user one.

95
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:35,730
In this part of
the problem, we're

96
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,970
considering a different
Bernoulli process,

97
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:40,820
with only the busy
slots, which means

98
00:06:40,820 --> 00:06:44,220
we take all the busy slots
from the original process

99
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:48,390
and form this new process
with only the busy slots.

100
00:06:48,390 --> 00:06:51,270
The parameter for this
new Bernoulli process

101
00:06:51,270 --> 00:06:59,290
is simply p1 given B, which
represents the probability

102
00:06:59,290 --> 00:07:09,190
that a task is from user
one for a busy slot.

103
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:17,720

104
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:21,260
Then, similar as
part (c), we now

105
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:25,320
define a new random
variable, N, which

106
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:34,810
represents the
number of busy slots

107
00:07:34,810 --> 00:07:42,780
until the fifth
task from user one.

108
00:07:42,780 --> 00:07:48,240

109
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:53,160
So here, N is a Pascal random
variable with order five

110
00:07:53,160 --> 00:07:57,070
and parameter of p1
given B. Therefore,

111
00:07:57,070 --> 00:08:02,700
the expected value
of N is equal to 5

112
00:08:02,700 --> 00:08:14,240
over p1 given B, which
is equal to 5 over 2/5,

113
00:08:14,240 --> 00:08:16,295
which is equal to 25/2.

114
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:20,590

115
00:08:20,590 --> 00:08:22,710
In part (e) of
the problem, we're

116
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:24,730
interested in a
random variable that

117
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:27,980
represents the number
of tasks from user two

118
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:31,710
until the time of the
fifth task from user one.

119
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:36,150
What this means is that
out of all the busy slots

120
00:08:36,150 --> 00:08:40,169
until the fifth task
from user one, T of them

121
00:08:40,169 --> 00:08:44,850
were from user two and five
of them were from user one.

122
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:48,370
As defined in part
(d), that N represents

123
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:51,800
the number of busy slots until
the fifth task from user one,

124
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:59,060
we have N equal to T plus 5.

125
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,190
That is, out of
all the busy slots

126
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:04,840
until the fifth task
from user one, T of them

127
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:09,190
were from user two and five
of them were from user one.

128
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:14,520
And therefore, we have
T equal to N minus 5.

129
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:17,980

130
00:09:17,980 --> 00:09:21,970
From part (d), we know
that the random variable

131
00:09:21,970 --> 00:09:25,950
N is a Pascal random
variable with order five

132
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:31,560
and parameter p1 given
B, which is equal to 2/5.

133
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:34,270
Therefore, we can derive
the distribution for T

134
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:38,450
from the distribution
for N. So we

135
00:09:38,450 --> 00:09:44,830
know that the distribution for
the Pascal random variable N

136
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:55,240
is equal to t minus 1
choose 5 minus 1, times 2/5

137
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,800
to the power of 5, times 1
minus 2/5 to the power of t

138
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:09,920
minus 5, for all t equal
to 5, 6, 7, and all.

139
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:13,200
And for all t less than
five, the probability for N

140
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,660
are all equal to 0.

141
00:10:15,660 --> 00:10:19,780
Therefore, the
probability of T is simply

142
00:10:19,780 --> 00:10:23,610
equal to the
probability of N at t

143
00:10:23,610 --> 00:10:35,890
plus 5, which is equal to t plus
4 choose 5 minus 1, times 2/5

144
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:43,386
to the power of 5 times 1
minus 2/5 to the power of t,

145
00:10:43,386 --> 00:10:51,430
for all t equal to 0, 1, 2, and
all, and for all t less than 0,

146
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:56,110
we have a probability
of T equal to 0.

147
00:10:56,110 --> 00:10:59,260
Similarly, we can find
expected value of T

148
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:08,680
from the expected value of N,
which is-- expected value of T

149
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:15,820
is equal to the expected
value of N minus 5,

150
00:11:15,820 --> 00:11:22,740
which is equal to 5
over 2/5, minus 5.

151
00:11:22,740 --> 00:11:25,020
And this comes from
the expected value

152
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:27,380
of a Pascal random variable.

153
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:31,860
And this gives us 7.5.

154
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:38,850
And similarly, the
variance of T is

155
00:11:38,850 --> 00:11:46,120
equal to the variance of the
Pascal random variable N,

156
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:57,310
which is equal to 5
times 1 minus 2/5,

157
00:11:57,310 --> 00:12:03,570
over 2/5 to the power of 2.

158
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:07,730

159
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:10,140
And this concludes
our today's practice

160
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:12,460
on the Bernoulli process.

161
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:13,192
