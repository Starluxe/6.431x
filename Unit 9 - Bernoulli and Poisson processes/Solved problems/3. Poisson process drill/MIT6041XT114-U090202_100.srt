00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,570

2
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,300
Hi.

3
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,150
In this session, we're going
to work on a drill problem

4
00:00:04,150 --> 00:00:07,780
to get some more practice
working with Poisson processes.

5
00:00:07,780 --> 00:00:10,290
So remember, a
Poisson process is

6
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:14,770
a process that models
how things arrive.

7
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,999
And the important
parameter is lambda,

8
00:00:16,999 --> 00:00:19,040
which is the arrival rate,
the number of arrivals

9
00:00:19,040 --> 00:00:20,950
per unit time.

10
00:00:20,950 --> 00:00:22,780
And another important
factor to remember

11
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:25,960
for this problem is that when
you consider disjoint time

12
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,110
intervals, whatever happens
in these two disjoint time

13
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:32,090
intervals is independent.

14
00:00:32,090 --> 00:00:34,505
So here in this
problem, we have trains

15
00:00:34,505 --> 00:00:36,440
that are crossing this bridge.

16
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:39,560
And we're told that the
trains arrive at this bridge

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:42,390
according to a Poisson
process at a rate of three

18
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,122
trains per day.

19
00:00:43,122 --> 00:00:44,830
So that doesn't mean
that there's exactly

20
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:45,845
three trains per day.

21
00:00:45,845 --> 00:00:48,270
It just means that
in some sense,

22
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:50,910
on average, three
trains come every day.

23
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:54,170
But the number of trains on
each day is actually random.

24
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:56,350
And an important
formula to remember

25
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:59,480
is that of a Poisson
distribution, which tells you

26
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,200
the probability of having k
arrivals over a period of tau

27
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:04,590
days.

28
00:01:04,590 --> 00:01:07,340
And that's equal to e
to the minus lambda tau,

29
00:01:07,340 --> 00:01:10,650
times lambda tau to
the k over k factorial.

30
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:14,580
OK, so the first
part of this problem

31
00:01:14,580 --> 00:01:19,060
asks us to find what is
the probability that you'll

32
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:22,900
have no trains arriving on
days one, two, and three,

33
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,560
supposing that there's a train
that arrived on day zero.

34
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,940
So the information
that we're given

35
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:32,060
is that there's a train
that arrived on day zero.

36
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:35,390
And then we're asked to
find a probability related

37
00:01:35,390 --> 00:01:37,620
to days one, two, and three.

38
00:01:37,620 --> 00:01:41,164
So what we should remember is
that disjoint time intervals

39
00:01:41,164 --> 00:01:41,830
are independent.

40
00:01:41,830 --> 00:01:43,807
So whatever happened
on day zero is

41
00:01:43,807 --> 00:01:46,140
independent of what happens
on days one, two, and three.

42
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:48,360
So we can actually just
forget about the fact

43
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:50,550
that a train
arrived on day zero,

44
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:53,890
and just focus on what happens
on days one, two, and three.

45
00:01:53,890 --> 00:01:56,030
So what we really
want is just, what's

46
00:01:56,030 --> 00:02:03,200
the probability of
0 trains in 3 days.

47
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,130
Days one, two, and
three cover 3 days.

48
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:09,160
And if we just now
apply this formula,

49
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,470
we can know exactly
how to find that.

50
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:16,000
So now k is 0, tau is
3, and lambda is 3,

51
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,340
given by the problem.

52
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,090
So what we get is e to
the minus lambda tau.

53
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:24,420
Lambda is 3, tau is 3, so
that's e to the minus 9,

54
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:32,380
times lambda tau is 9, to the
k, which is 0, over 0 factorial.

55
00:02:32,380 --> 00:02:33,510
So 9 to the 0 is 1.

56
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:34,640
0 factorial is 1.

57
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,620
So all you're left with
is just e to the minus 9.

58
00:02:37,620 --> 00:02:42,190
And that is the probability of
having no trains in three days.

59
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:45,190
So just remember that disjoint
time intervals are independent,

60
00:02:45,190 --> 00:02:47,980
and don't get tripped
up over information

61
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:50,870
that actually is irrelevant.

62
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:53,400
Now, part (b)--
we're asked to find,

63
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:57,000
what is the probability that
if a train arrives on day

64
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,830
zero that it takes more than
three days for the next train

65
00:02:59,830 --> 00:03:01,560
to arrive?

66
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:03,660
Well, if you think
about that, really, it's

67
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,180
asking the exact same
thing as part (a),

68
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:08,850
because the event that
the next train takes

69
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,880
more than three days
is exactly the same

70
00:03:10,880 --> 00:03:14,560
as there being no trains
in the next three days.

71
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:19,130
So in fact, this is exactly
equal to the same probability

72
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:21,350
that we calculated in part
(a)-- e to the minus 9.

73
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:24,560

74
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:27,000
Part (c) now says,
what's the probability

75
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,510
that you have no trains on days
one and two-- the first two

76
00:03:30,510 --> 00:03:34,630
days-- but four trains
on the fourth day?

77
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:38,310
OK, so now this question
involves days one and two

78
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:39,700
and day four.

79
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:43,665
So again, let's
rely on this fact,

80
00:03:43,665 --> 00:03:45,540
that disjoint time
intervals are independent.

81
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,440
So we can actually
calculate the probability

82
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,444
of no trains in
the first two days,

83
00:03:50,444 --> 00:03:51,860
and then calculate
the probability

84
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:53,240
of four trains on
the fourth day,

85
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:56,270
and combine them, because
they're independent.

86
00:03:56,270 --> 00:03:58,380
So the probability
that we're looking for

87
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:13,140
is 0 trains in days one and
two, and 4 trains on day four.

88
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,850

89
00:04:16,850 --> 00:04:19,110
But because this
is independent, we

90
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,079
can actually calculate the
probability of this first part,

91
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:23,690
the probability of
the second part,

92
00:04:23,690 --> 00:04:25,290
and multiply them together.

93
00:04:25,290 --> 00:04:28,700
So what's the probability of
no trains in days one and two?

94
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:30,920
Well, that is just,
again, probability

95
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:34,420
of no arrivals in a
duration of length 2,

96
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:38,150
which again, we can calculate
using this formula, where

97
00:04:38,150 --> 00:04:40,580
k is 0 and tau is now 2.

98
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:44,620
So what we get is e to
the minus lambda tau--

99
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:48,290
lambda tau here
is minus 6-- times

100
00:04:48,290 --> 00:04:51,250
6 to the 0 over 0 factorial.

101
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:53,760
So that's the first
part, the probability

102
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:56,060
of 0 trains in days one and two.

103
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:58,870
Now, what's the probability
of 4 trains in day four?

104
00:04:58,870 --> 00:05:00,640
Well, we want now
the probability

105
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:04,070
of 4 arrivals in a
duration of length 1,

106
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:07,730
which we can, again, use
this formula to calculate.

107
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,950
That's going to be e to
the minus lambda tau.

108
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,850
Now, tau is 1, and k we
want to be equal to 4.

109
00:05:14,850 --> 00:05:18,330
So lambda tau is 3.

110
00:05:18,330 --> 00:05:26,020
And we want lambda tau-- 3 to
the fourth over 4 factorial.

111
00:05:26,020 --> 00:05:28,250
And now, that is just
going to be equal

112
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:32,900
to-- we can pull out an
e to the minus 9 here.

113
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:35,990
This 6 to the 0 over 0
factorial is just one.

114
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:40,130
And then the rest of it is just
times 3 to the fourth over 4

115
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:40,630
factorial.

116
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,322

117
00:05:44,322 --> 00:05:45,780
We can simplify it
if we wanted to.

118
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:49,860

119
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:51,790
So again, that
relied on this fact

120
00:05:51,790 --> 00:05:53,820
that disjoint time
intervals are independent,

121
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:56,620
and that's an
important tool to have.

122
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:59,070
The next and last
part of this problem

123
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:06,290
asks us for the probability that
it'll take more than two days

124
00:06:06,290 --> 00:06:08,360
for the fifth train to arrive.

125
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:14,150
So we want the probability
that more than 2 days

126
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,800
for the fifth train.

127
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,540

128
00:06:21,540 --> 00:06:24,220
Well, what's another
way of saying that?

129
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:27,115
In order to take more than
2 days for the fifth train

130
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:28,920
to arrive, that's
exactly the same

131
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:36,280
as saying there was no
more than four trains

132
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:39,415
in the first 2 days.

133
00:06:39,415 --> 00:06:42,740

134
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:45,600
So we've transformed this into
something about the number

135
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,910
of days until a certain arrival
to the number of arrivals

136
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:54,590
within a certain number of days,
because if you have no more

137
00:06:54,590 --> 00:06:56,090
than 4 trains in
the first 2 days,

138
00:06:56,090 --> 00:07:00,650
then the fifth train could
not have arrived until after 2

139
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:03,450
days.

140
00:07:03,450 --> 00:07:07,750
Obviously, you can calculate
using either of these.

141
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:11,660
In this way, you would have
to know something about

142
00:07:11,660 --> 00:07:14,750
the distribution of
the fifth arrival time,

143
00:07:14,750 --> 00:07:18,170
and calculate the probability
that being greater than 2,

144
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:19,220
which you could do.

145
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,100
Alternatively, you could
also re-frame it in terms

146
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:25,560
of the probability of having
no more than a certain number

147
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,150
of arrivals within
the first 2 days.

148
00:07:28,150 --> 00:07:33,730
So let's do it, in this case,
using the second method.

149
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:36,130
We want, now, the probability
of no more than 4 trains

150
00:07:36,130 --> 00:07:37,710
in the first 2 days.

151
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:41,445
Well, that's the same as the
probability of there beings 0

152
00:07:41,445 --> 00:07:44,070
trains in the first 2 days,
plus the probability of being 1

153
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:47,810
train, and so on, all
the way up to 4 trains,

154
00:07:47,810 --> 00:07:51,426
because you can't have both 1
train in the first 2 days and 2

155
00:07:51,426 --> 00:07:52,550
trains in the first 2 days.

156
00:07:52,550 --> 00:07:55,680
So those probabilities
you can just add up.

157
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,060
And so it turns out that it's
just equal to the probability

158
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:06,440
of the sum for k equals 0 up to
4 of the probability of having

159
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,700
exactly k arrivals in 2 days.

160
00:08:08,700 --> 00:08:12,850
So the probability of having
k arrivals in 2 days is just e

161
00:08:12,850 --> 00:08:14,760
to the minus lambda tau.

162
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,370
Lambda is 3, still.

163
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:19,060
Tau is 2 now, so it's
e to the minus 6,

164
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,780
times 6 to the k
over k factorial.

165
00:08:22,780 --> 00:08:26,760

166
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:29,670
And now we can
simplify this somewhat,

167
00:08:29,670 --> 00:08:32,150
and actually calculate out
what the summation equals.

168
00:08:32,150 --> 00:08:34,330
We pull out e to the minus 6.

169
00:08:34,330 --> 00:08:38,190
Then we get 6 to the
0 over 0 factorial,

170
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:42,159
plus 6 to the first
power over 1 factorial,

171
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:48,670
plus all the way to 6 to
the fourth over 4 factorial.

172
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:53,400
And now the last part is, we
can actually calculate out what

173
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:55,110
that number is equal to.

174
00:08:55,110 --> 00:09:01,430
And it turns out it's equal
to 115 times e to the minus 6.

175
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:07,350
OK, so this last problem
just demonstrates that

176
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:10,959
there's multiple ways of
framing any particular problem.

177
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:12,750
You can frame it in
terms of arrival times,

178
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:16,690
or you can frame it in terms
of the number of arrivals.

179
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,590
And depending on the situation,
maybe one way is easier than

180
00:09:19,590 --> 00:09:20,650
the other one.

181
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:25,320
OK, so that was just a quick
drill problem for Poisson

182
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:26,150
processes.

183
00:09:26,150 --> 00:09:29,310
And I hope that was helpful,
and see you next time.
