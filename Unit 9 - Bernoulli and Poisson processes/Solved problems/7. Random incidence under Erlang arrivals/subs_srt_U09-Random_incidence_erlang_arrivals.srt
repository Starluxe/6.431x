00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,950

2
00:00:00,950 --> 00:00:01,530
Hi.

3
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,059
In this problem, we're going
to look at random incidence

4
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:05,910
under Erlang arrivals.

5
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:08,230
First, let's parse
what that means.

6
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:12,970
In a Poisson process, remember,
the time between arrivals,

7
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,050
or the inter-arrival
time, is distributed

8
00:00:15,050 --> 00:00:17,710
as an exponential
random variable.

9
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:21,610
And random incidence
for a Poisson process

10
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:23,500
refers to the somewhat
surprising result

11
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,170
that when you consider
a specific time,

12
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:31,010
say, t-star, then the length
of the inter-arrival interval

13
00:00:31,010 --> 00:00:34,510
that contains that time
t-star is not distributed

14
00:00:34,510 --> 00:00:39,500
as an exponential
random variable.

15
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:42,830
It's actually distributed as an
Erlang random variable of order

16
00:00:42,830 --> 00:00:47,050
2 or it's distributed
as a sum of two

17
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:48,530
exponential random variables.

18
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:52,080
And the reason for that is
that it comprises of two parts.

19
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:56,180
One is the time since
the last arrival

20
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:59,980
until t-star, which is
exponentially distributed,

21
00:00:59,980 --> 00:01:03,980
and the time from t-star
until the next arrival, which

22
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:06,170
is also exponentially
distributed.

23
00:01:06,170 --> 00:01:08,140
So that brings us
to a review of what

24
00:01:08,140 --> 00:01:10,190
Erlang random variables are.

25
00:01:10,190 --> 00:01:12,540
An Erlang random
variable of order k

26
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:16,280
is just the sum of k
independent and identically

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:18,760
distributed exponential
random variables.

28
00:01:18,760 --> 00:01:23,200
So to be more specific, if Ti is
an exponential random variable

29
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:28,700
with parameter lambda, then
if you take k iid copies of Ti

30
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,350
and add them up,
and call that Yk,

31
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,330
then Yk is an Erlang
random variable of order k.

32
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:40,740
And one other fact is
that the mean of Yk,

33
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,420
the mean of an Erlang
random variable of order k,

34
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:47,040
is just k, the
order, over lambda,

35
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,185
which is the rate of the
underlying exponential random

36
00:01:50,185 --> 00:01:51,960
variables.

37
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,395
So as a consequence, if you
have an Erlang random variable

38
00:01:55,395 --> 00:01:59,210
of order two and that random
variable also has a mean of two

39
00:01:59,210 --> 00:02:02,850
over lambda, we can interpret
that random variable as just

40
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,620
being the sum of two
exponential random variables.

41
00:02:05,620 --> 00:02:08,500
2 iid exponential random
variables, T1 and T2,

42
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:14,300
where each one is exponential
with the rate lambda.

43
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:17,920
OK, so in this problem now,
we're dealing with random

44
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,200
incidence not under
Poisson processes,

45
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:25,140
but under something else, which
we call here an Erlang process

46
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:28,180
with Erlang arrival times.

47
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:31,430
So to be more specific,
what we're saying is that,

48
00:02:31,430 --> 00:02:34,470
instead of an inter-arrival
time being exponentially

49
00:02:34,470 --> 00:02:38,260
distributed, in this process, an
inter-arrival time is actually

50
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:42,690
distributed as an Erlang random
variable of order 2 with mean 2

51
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:43,800
over lambda.

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:48,740
So to be explicit, this is
no longer a Poisson process.

53
00:02:48,740 --> 00:02:53,260
It's some other process because
the inter-arrival times are not

54
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,620
exponential.

55
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:57,730
So let's make use of this fact
that we talked about earlier

56
00:02:57,730 --> 00:03:00,770
because now we know that the
inter-arrival times of this

57
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,450
Erlang process are Erlang order
2 with mean 2 over lambda.

58
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:08,440
But we know that that can just
be re-interpreted as a sum

59
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,320
of two simple exponentials,
each with parameter lambda.

60
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:20,910
So let's just draw another
picture and imagine that

61
00:03:20,910 --> 00:03:25,070
for each of these arrivals,
so say we have three sample

62
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,320
arrivals in this Erlang
process, we can fill in, kind

63
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:38,060
of, the gaps between these
with additional arrivals.

64
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:48,980
And then think of each one
of these times as all being

65
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:54,050
exponential with
parameter lambda.

66
00:03:54,050 --> 00:03:58,040
So this is a valid
interpretation because when we

67
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:08,440
connect these, these
inter-arrival times correspond

68
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,320
to the combination of
two inter-arrival times,

69
00:04:11,320 --> 00:04:15,490
which we know we can split that
into just two exponentials.

70
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:19,060
So each one of these is an
exponential random variable.

71
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,980
And when you combine them,
you get an Erlang order of 2.

72
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:27,300
But the nice thing about this
is that if we look at this

73
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:36,060
diagram, it actually is just
exactly a Poisson process with

74
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,020
a rate lambda because now,
what we're dealing with are

75
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:45,930
exactly-- the inter-arrival
times are now exactly

76
00:04:45,930 --> 00:04:47,460
exponential random variables.

77
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:52,770
And so this is in fact, now,
just a simple Poisson process.

78
00:04:52,770 --> 00:04:59,290
And we can also just think of it
as we take the Poisson process,

79
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:01,960
and take every
other arrival, say,

80
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:06,730
all the even-numbered arrivals,
and make those correspond

81
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:11,440
to the arrivals in
the Erlang process.

82
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:18,810
OK, so now let's think about
some specific time t-star.

83
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:28,910
We want to know what is the
distribution of the length

84
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:35,910
of this specific inter-arrival
interval that t-star is in.

85
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,290
Well, what we can do is take
it down to the level of this

86
00:05:41,290 --> 00:05:43,500
Poisson process and
look at it from there.

87
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:48,010
Well, we do that because,
for a Poisson process,

88
00:05:48,010 --> 00:05:51,910
we know about random incidence
for Poisson processes.

89
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,190
And we know how to deal
with Poisson processes.

90
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:57,660
So let's think about this now.

91
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,890
Well, t-star is here.

92
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:03,855
And what we know from random
incidence for a Poisson process

93
00:06:03,855 --> 00:06:09,380
is that the length of this
inter-arrival interval

94
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:15,660
for the Poisson process, we
know that this is an exponential

95
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:17,180
plus an exponential.

96
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:25,780
So combined, this
is Erlang order 2.

97
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:30,100

98
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:34,070
But that only covers
from here to here.

99
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:36,580
And what we want is
actually from here to there.

100
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:42,730
Well now, we tack on an extra
exponential because we know

101
00:06:42,730 --> 00:06:46,000
that the inter-arrival times--
the time between this arrival

102
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,310
and that arrival in the
Poisson process is just another

103
00:06:48,310 --> 00:06:49,670
exponential.

104
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:52,720
And now all of these are
in disjoint time intervals.

105
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:54,100
And they're all independent.

106
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,610
And so the time of this
inter-arrival interval

107
00:06:58,610 --> 00:07:02,200
in the Erlang process is just
going to be the sum of three

108
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:06,670
independent exponentials within
the underlying Poisson process.

109
00:07:06,670 --> 00:07:09,270
And so the answer
here is actually,

110
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:13,790
it's going to be an
Erlang of order 3.

111
00:07:13,790 --> 00:07:16,960

112
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:20,680
Now this is one possible
scenario for how this might

113
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:21,610
occur.

114
00:07:21,610 --> 00:07:27,830
Another scenario is actually
that t-star is somewhere else.

115
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:29,760
So let's draw this again.

116
00:07:29,760 --> 00:07:34,300

117
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:45,880
And suppose now, in this case,
t-star landed between an even

118
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:49,590
numbered arrival in the Poisson
process and an odd numbered

119
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,880
arrival.

120
00:07:50,880 --> 00:07:54,000
Now it could also arrive between
an odd numbered and an even

121
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,560
numbered arrival.

122
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:02,170
So it could be that
t-star is actually here.

123
00:08:02,170 --> 00:08:04,690
Well, but in this case, it's
actually more or less the same

124
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:11,110
thing because now what we want
is the length of this entire

125
00:08:11,110 --> 00:08:14,120
inter-arrival interval,
which, in the Poisson world,

126
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,030
we can break it down into random
incidence within this interval,

127
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:23,800
this inter-arrival interval,
which is two exponentials,

128
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,710
or an Erlang of 2,
plus this interval,

129
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,750
which is just a standard
inter-arrival time,

130
00:08:31,750 --> 00:08:33,360
which is another exponential.

131
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,530
So in this case as well, we have
the sum of three independent

132
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,900
exponential random variables.

133
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:44,130
And so, in either case, we have
that the inter-arrival time

134
00:08:44,130 --> 00:08:48,250
in the Erlang process
is an Erlang of order 3.

135
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:50,260
And so the final
answer is, in fact,

136
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,930
that the inter-arrival time for
random incidence under these

137
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:59,030
Erlang-type arrivals is
an Erlang of order 3.

138
00:08:59,030 --> 00:09:04,490
OK, so in this problem we looked
at the random incidence under

139
00:09:04,490 --> 00:09:07,290
a different type of an
arrival process, not Poisson,

140
00:09:07,290 --> 00:09:09,270
but with Erlang
random variables.

141
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,600
But we used the insight
that Erlang really can be

142
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:16,110
re-interpreted as the sum of
independent and identically

143
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:18,155
distributed exponential
random variables.

144
00:09:18,155 --> 00:09:25,320
And exponential random variables
can be viewed as one way

145
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:27,990
of interpreting and
viewing a Poisson process.

146
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:30,510
And so by going
through those steps,

147
00:09:30,510 --> 00:09:33,940
we were able to use what we know
about random incidence under

148
00:09:33,940 --> 00:09:37,300
Poisson processes to help us
solve this problem of random

149
00:09:37,300 --> 00:09:39,030
incidence under Erlang arrivals.

150
00:09:39,030 --> 00:09:40,510
So I hope that was helpful.

151
00:09:40,510 --> 00:09:42,960
And I'll see you next time.

152
00:09:42,960 --> 00:09:44,334
