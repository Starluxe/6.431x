00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,500

00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,720
Hi everyone.

3
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:04,370
Today I'm going to talk about
Bernoulli process practice

4
00:00:04,370 --> 00:00:05,840
number one.

5
00:00:05,840 --> 00:00:09,290
In this problem, you are
visiting a rain forest.

6
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:12,920
But unfortunately you have
run out of insect repellent.

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:16,020
As a result, the probability
of you getting mosquito bites

8
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:17,350
is really high.

9
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,720
At each second, the
probability that a mosquito

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:23,820
will land on your neck is 0.5.

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,650
If a mosquito
lands on your neck,

12
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:29,210
the probability that it
will bite you is 0.2.

13
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:33,520
And the probability that it
will never bother you is 0.8.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:35,260
All of this happens
independently

15
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:37,400
among all mosquitoes.

16
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:39,410
For part (a) of
the problem, we're

17
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:41,680
interested in finding
the expected value

18
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,400
of the time between
successive mosquito bites

19
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:47,260
and the variance of the time
between successive mosquito

20
00:00:47,260 --> 00:00:48,680
bites.

21
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:50,930
From the problem
statement we know

22
00:00:50,930 --> 00:00:53,060
that the probability
distributions

23
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:55,770
of getting mosquito
bites at different times

24
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:59,400
are identically distributed
and independent.

25
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:03,480
Therefore, the mosquito bites
occur as a Bernoulli process

26
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,990
with parameter p, where p
represents the probability

27
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:10,210
of getting a mosquito
bite at each second.

28
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:16,080
And p can be calculated
as the probability

29
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:21,610
that a mosquito lands on
your neck at each second

30
00:01:21,610 --> 00:01:25,650
multiplied by the probability
that a mosquito will bite you,

31
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,220
given that it has
landed on your neck.

32
00:01:28,220 --> 00:01:33,170

33
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:43,410
And this is equal to 0.5 times
0.2, which is equal to 0.1.

34
00:01:43,410 --> 00:01:47,700
Next let us define X as the
time between successive mosquito

35
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,540
bites.

36
00:01:49,540 --> 00:01:51,570
Because of the
memoryless property

37
00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:54,250
of the Bernoulli
process, which means

38
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:55,920
the probability of
getting mosquito

39
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,720
bites at different
times are independent,

40
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:02,890
X is equivalent to the time
until the next mosquito bite.

41
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:05,700
And X is a geometrical
random variable

42
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,770
whose PMF is like the following.

43
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:17,030

44
00:02:17,030 --> 00:02:20,180
For all x, less
than or equal to 0,

45
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:23,570
the probabilities
are equal to 0.

46
00:02:23,570 --> 00:02:26,370
For x equal to 1,
the probability

47
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:29,940
that it takes 1 second
to the next mosquito bite

48
00:02:29,940 --> 00:02:33,720
is simply equal to p.

49
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,470
And for x equal to
2, the probability

50
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:40,440
that it takes 2 seconds
until the next mosquito

51
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,890
bite is equal to
1 minus p times p.

52
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:47,710

53
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:50,400
And for x equal to
3, the probability

54
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,270
that it takes 3 seconds until
the next mosquito bite is equal

55
00:02:54,270 --> 00:03:00,360
to 1 minus p to the
power of 2, times p.

56
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:04,090
Similarly, for x equal
to k, the probability

57
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,420
that it takes k seconds
until the next mosquito bite

58
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,960
is equal to 1 minus p to the
power of k minus 1, times p.

59
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:16,550

60
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:21,500
Therefore the expected
value of X is equal to 1

61
00:03:21,500 --> 00:03:28,880
over p, which is equal to 1
over 0.1, which is equal to 10.

62
00:03:28,880 --> 00:03:37,430
And the variance of X is equal
to 1 minus p over p squared,

63
00:03:37,430 --> 00:03:44,530
which is equal to 1 minus
0.1 over 0.1 squared, which

64
00:03:44,530 --> 00:03:47,270
is equal to 90.

65
00:03:47,270 --> 00:03:49,270
For part (b) of
the problem, we're

66
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,660
considering another type of bug.

67
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:57,000
Similar to the case as the
mosquitoes, here at each second

68
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,160
the probability that a
tick will land on your neck

69
00:04:00,160 --> 00:04:02,600
is equal to 0.1.

70
00:04:02,600 --> 00:04:04,820
And if a tick
lands on your neck,

71
00:04:04,820 --> 00:04:08,310
the probability that it will
bite you is equal to 0.7.

72
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:10,510
And the probability that
it will never bother you

73
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:12,630
is equal to 0.3.

74
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,840
And all this happens
independently

75
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:18,339
among all ticks
and all mosquitoes.

76
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:20,230
So similar to the
case as part (a),

77
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:23,550
where mosquito bites
occur as a Bernoulli

78
00:04:23,550 --> 00:04:26,840
process with parameter
p equal to 0.1,

79
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,230
here the tick bites also
occur as a Bernoulli process

80
00:04:30,230 --> 00:04:33,100
with parameter q
equal to 0.1 times

81
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:36,660
0.7, which is equal to 0.07.

82
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:40,700
And q is the probability
of getting a tick

83
00:04:40,700 --> 00:04:43,910
bite at each second.

84
00:04:43,910 --> 00:04:49,120
Therefore, the bug bites
occur as a merged process

85
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,570
from the mosquito bites
and the tick bites.

86
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:57,640
And let r represent the
parameter for the bug bites.

87
00:04:57,640 --> 00:05:02,480
So here r is equal
to the probability

88
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:11,467
of getting either a mosquito
bite or a tick bite.

89
00:05:11,467 --> 00:05:23,460

90
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:27,900
And this is equivalent to
1 minus the probability

91
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:42,743
of getting no mosquito
bite and no tick bite.

92
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:47,440

93
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:49,360
Because the mosquito
bites and the tick

94
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:52,390
bites happen independently,
therefore, this

95
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:57,710
can be written as 1 minus the
probability of no mosquito

96
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:12,380
bites times the probability of
no tick bites at each second.

97
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:19,890
And this is equal to 1
minus p times 1 minus q,

98
00:06:19,890 --> 00:06:27,590
which is p plus
q minus pq, which

99
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:37,370
is equal to 0.1 plus
0.7 minus 0.1 times 0.7.

100
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:45,130
Which is equal to 0.163.

101
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:54,438
Next, let us define Y as the
time between successive bug

102
00:06:54,438 --> 00:06:54,938
bites.

103
00:06:54,938 --> 00:07:08,780

104
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:14,090
So similar as X in
part (a), here Y

105
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:18,550
is a geometric distribution
with parameter r.

106
00:07:18,550 --> 00:07:25,770
And therefore the expected
value of Y is equal to 1

107
00:07:25,770 --> 00:07:31,850
over r, which is
equal to 1 over 0.163.

108
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:37,930
That is approximately 6.135.

109
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:51,740
And the variance of Y is equal
to 1 minus r over r squared,

110
00:07:51,740 --> 00:08:02,120
which is equal to 1 minus
0.163 over 0.163 squared.

111
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:10,700
And this is
approximately 31.503.

112
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:19,500
So this gives us
the expected value

113
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:21,950
of the time between
successive bug bites

114
00:08:21,950 --> 00:08:25,950
and the variance of the time
between successive bug bites.

115
00:08:25,950 --> 00:08:30,550
And this concludes our today's
practice on Bernoulli process.
