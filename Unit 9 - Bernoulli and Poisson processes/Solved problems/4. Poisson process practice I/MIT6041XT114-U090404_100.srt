1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,190

2
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:01,750
Hi.

3
00:00:01,750 --> 00:00:03,416
In this problem, we're
going to practice

4
00:00:03,416 --> 00:00:05,890
working with Poisson processes.

5
00:00:05,890 --> 00:00:08,490
And what we have is a
sequence of light bulbs

6
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:11,640
that we're going to start
using, starting at time equal 0.

7
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,700
And we use them
one after another.

8
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:15,390
And as soon as one
light bulb dies out,

9
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:17,190
we immediately replace
it with another one.

10
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:18,690
And we have two
types of light bulbs

11
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:21,600
to choose from-- type A
bulbs and type B bulbs.

12
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,500
And every time we have to
choose a new light bulb,

13
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:27,590
we pick type A or type B
with equal probability.

14
00:00:27,590 --> 00:00:34,136
And also, whether we pick A or
B for any one particular light

15
00:00:34,136 --> 00:00:35,510
bulb is independent
of whether we

16
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:39,450
pick A or B for any
other light bulb.

17
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,930
And the problem also tells us
how long each light bulb lasts.

18
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,530
And it's random.

19
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:50,150
And for type A, we know
from the distribution

20
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:53,960
that type A bulbs last for
an exponentially distributed

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,680
amount of time with
parameter lambda equals 1.

22
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,350
And type B bulbs last for
an exponentially distributed

23
00:00:59,350 --> 00:01:02,200
amount of time with
parameter lambda equals 3.

24
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:06,270
And so type A bulbs
last, on average,

25
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:08,004
longer than type B bulbs.

26
00:01:08,004 --> 00:01:09,420
And the last thing
that we're told

27
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:13,000
is that how long any
given type A bulb lasts

28
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,850
is independent of how long
any other type A bulb lasts.

29
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,600
And it's also
independent of how long

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,600
any other type B bulb lasts.

31
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,330
And the same thing
for type B bulbs.

32
00:01:22,330 --> 00:01:25,390
Now, the first thing that
we're going to look at

33
00:01:25,390 --> 00:01:30,630
is, what is the expected
time until the first failure?

34
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:33,110
So we start out at
time 0 with a new bulb.

35
00:01:33,110 --> 00:01:34,595
And we want to
know, how long is it

36
00:01:34,595 --> 00:01:35,970
going to take, on
average, before

37
00:01:35,970 --> 00:01:39,030
that first light bulb dies?

38
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:50,560
So let's call that T1, the
time until the first failure.

39
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,550
And what we want to find is
the expected value of T1.

40
00:01:55,550 --> 00:01:58,880
Well, the first thing
that we're going to notice

41
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:01,920
is that this depends on whether
the first bulb that we chose

42
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,720
was a type A bulb
or a type B bulb.

43
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:08,900
So let's use total expectation.

44
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,470
And we'll break that
up into the two cases.

45
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:18,370
So let's let A denote the event
that the first bulb was type A.

46
00:02:18,370 --> 00:02:21,550
So we have the expected time
until the first failure,

47
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,290
given that it was a type A bulb.

48
00:02:23,290 --> 00:02:25,180
We multiply that
by the probability

49
00:02:25,180 --> 00:02:28,370
that it was actually
a type A bulb.

50
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:36,140
And then we do the same thing
conditioning on the fact

51
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,340
that it was actually
a type B bulb.

52
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:39,840
OK.

53
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,780
So what are all these values?

54
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,250
Well, if we know that
it's a type A bulb,

55
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:48,510
then the time until the
first failure is just---

56
00:02:48,510 --> 00:02:50,990
the expected time until
the first failure,

57
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:53,740
it's just the expected value of
an exponential with parameter

58
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:57,350
lambda equal to 1, which
we know for an exponential,

59
00:02:57,350 --> 00:02:59,660
the expected value
is 1 over lambda.

60
00:02:59,660 --> 00:03:03,280
And so this conditional
expectation is one.

61
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,010
The probability that we choose
type A for the first bulb

62
00:03:07,010 --> 00:03:09,000
is-- we know from
the problem that it's

63
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,300
just equal probability.

64
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:12,410
So it's 1/2.

65
00:03:12,410 --> 00:03:14,440
Similarly, if it's
a type B bulb,

66
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:17,100
we know that the time is
just the expected value

67
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:21,780
of an exponential with parameter
lambda equals 3, which is 1/3.

68
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:26,380
And this probability is also
1/2 of choosing type B bulb.

69
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:27,920
And when we add
this together, we

70
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:30,775
get that this is equal to 2/3.

71
00:03:30,775 --> 00:03:35,710

72
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:38,850
For part (b), we
want to find, what

73
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:41,260
is the probability
that there's no failure

74
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:45,600
before some arbitrary time t?

75
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:50,170
So let's say this is
some arbitrary time t.

76
00:03:50,170 --> 00:03:52,070
What's the probability
that there's

77
00:03:52,070 --> 00:03:55,300
no failure before this time?

78
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,410
Well, there's no failure
before this time, that's

79
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:00,770
equivalent to saying that
the first bulb that we used,

80
00:04:00,770 --> 00:04:03,360
it lasted longer than t.

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:09,525
So in terms of the random
variable T1 that we defined,

82
00:04:09,525 --> 00:04:11,150
what we want to find
is the probability

83
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,010
that T1 is greater
than little t.

84
00:04:16,010 --> 00:04:19,560
And again, that depends on
whether it's a type A bulb

85
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:21,800
that we're using
or a type B bulb.

86
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:25,230
So let's use total probability
here and break it up

87
00:04:25,230 --> 00:04:28,740
into the two possible cases.

88
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:32,900
If it's a type A bulb,
this is the probability.

89
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:42,530
And if it's a type
B bulb, we get this.

90
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:44,580
And now we need
to figure out what

91
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:47,620
these different pieces are.

92
00:04:47,620 --> 00:04:50,260
If it's a type A bulb, the
probably that T1 is greater

93
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:53,900
than t is just the probability
that an exponential random

94
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:58,360
variable with parameter
1 is greater than some t.

95
00:04:58,360 --> 00:05:04,260
And from the exponential random
variable, 1 minus the CDF,

96
00:05:04,260 --> 00:05:06,470
we know that that is
equal to-- in general,

97
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:09,960
it's e to the minus lambda t.

98
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:12,060
And so in this
case, lambda is 1.

99
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,450
And so this is just
e to the minus t.

100
00:05:15,450 --> 00:05:18,730
And we get 1/2 from
the probability

101
00:05:18,730 --> 00:05:22,070
that it's actually
a type A bulb.

102
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:24,986
And similarly, if
it's type B, then it's

103
00:05:24,986 --> 00:05:27,110
the probability that an
exponential random variable

104
00:05:27,110 --> 00:05:30,220
with parameter 3
is greater than t.

105
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:36,420
And so in that case, it's e
to the minus 3t times 1/2.

106
00:05:36,420 --> 00:05:37,780
And so that gives us our answer.

107
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:40,370

108
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:42,310
Let's move on to part (c).

109
00:05:42,310 --> 00:05:45,380
Part (c) wants us
to know, suppose

110
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:52,880
that we do we know that there
was no failure in the first t

111
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:58,330
time, or equivalently, that the
first bulb lasted more than t.

112
00:05:58,330 --> 00:06:01,130
What's the probability
that this bulb was type A?

113
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:03,790

114
00:06:03,790 --> 00:06:07,660
So what's the
probability that it's

115
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:12,260
type A, given that
T1 is greater than t?

116
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:14,320
And so in effect,
we're now trying

117
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:21,050
to flip this and calculate or
try to infer whether or not

118
00:06:21,050 --> 00:06:23,670
it's type A based on the
data that we collected,

119
00:06:23,670 --> 00:06:25,890
which is how long the
bulb actually lasted.

120
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:30,270
And so this is now going to be
an application of Bayes' rule,

121
00:06:30,270 --> 00:06:33,240
which tells us that this is
equal to the probability that

122
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:39,630
it's type A bulb times the
probability that it lasted more

123
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:41,553
than t, given that
it was a type A bulb,

124
00:06:41,553 --> 00:06:47,600
over the probability that--- the
unconditional probability that

125
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,150
it lasted more than t.

126
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:50,650
OK.

127
00:06:50,650 --> 00:06:53,360
So the probability
that it's A is 1/2.

128
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:56,720
The probability that
T1 is greater than t

129
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,610
given that it's A we already
calculated over here.

130
00:06:59,610 --> 00:07:03,790
It's e to the minus t.

131
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:07,310
And the probability that--
the unconditional probably we

132
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:08,720
just calculated in part (b).

133
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,705
So we'll substitute
that in the denominator.

134
00:07:10,705 --> 00:07:14,380

135
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,320
And the answer that
we get is this-- 1/2 e

136
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:21,010
to the minus t over 1/2
e to the minus t plus 1/2

137
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:22,010
e to the minus 3t.

138
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:28,120

139
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,070
OK.

140
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:33,560
Now, part (d) asks us
to find the variance

141
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:36,030
of how long the
first bulb lasts.

142
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,190
So what is the variance of T1?

143
00:07:39,190 --> 00:07:41,930

144
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:47,691
To find the variance of T1,
let's use this expression.

145
00:07:47,691 --> 00:07:49,690
The variance of T1 is
equal to the [expectation]

146
00:07:49,690 --> 00:07:55,975
of T1 squared minus
the expectation

147
00:07:55,975 --> 00:08:00,200
of T1 quantity squared.

148
00:08:00,200 --> 00:08:02,590
We already know what
expectation of T1 is.

149
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,250
It's 2/3.

150
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:04,711
We calculated that in part (a).

151
00:08:04,711 --> 00:08:06,210
But we still need
to figure out what

152
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:08,525
the expectation
of T1 squared is.

153
00:08:08,525 --> 00:08:11,030

154
00:08:11,030 --> 00:08:16,690
Now, expectation of T1
squared-- we can again

155
00:08:16,690 --> 00:08:19,550
use the same sort of
idea and break it up

156
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:22,660
into the two cases-- the first
case that's is a type A bulb,

157
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,670
the second that
it's type B bulb.

158
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:27,840
So this is equal to
expectation of T1 squared given

159
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,270
that it's A times
the probability

160
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:38,200
that it's A, plus expectation
of T1 squared given that it's

161
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:45,847
B times the probability
that it's B. OK.

162
00:08:45,847 --> 00:08:50,360
And we know that given
that it's a type A bulb,

163
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,670
this T1 is now exponential
with parameter 1.

164
00:08:54,670 --> 00:08:59,340
And so we know from exponentials
that the expectation

165
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:05,140
of the square of an exponential
random variable is just---

166
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:09,800
expectation of the square of an
exponential random variable is

167
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,306
2 over lambda squared.

168
00:09:13,306 --> 00:09:17,290
And so in this case, for
type A bulbs, lambda is 1.

169
00:09:17,290 --> 00:09:20,660
So it's 2 over lambda
squared is just 2.

170
00:09:20,660 --> 00:09:23,590
So this is 2 times 1/2
for the first case.

171
00:09:23,590 --> 00:09:26,700
For type B bulbs, lambda is 3.

172
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:34,200
So this expectation is 2 over
3 squared, or 2/9 times 1/2.

173
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:36,945
And so we get 1
plus 1/9 is 10/9.

174
00:09:36,945 --> 00:09:40,290

175
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:42,910
And so after we
substitute all that in,

176
00:09:42,910 --> 00:09:52,470
we see that this variance of
T1 is equal to 10/9 minus 2/3,

177
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:56,010
from part (a),
squared, which is 4/9.

178
00:09:56,010 --> 00:09:58,540
That gives us 6/9, or 2/3.

179
00:09:58,540 --> 00:10:08,010

180
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:15,560
For part (e), what we're told
is that we have 12 failures.

181
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:17,680
And we want to know,
what is the probability

182
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:26,970
that the 12th failure is the
4th failure of a type A bulb?

183
00:10:26,970 --> 00:10:30,920
So let's draw out a timeline
here, starting at time 0.

184
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:36,880
So here are some failures.

185
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:39,560
So suppose that
there are exactly

186
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,470
12 total failures
here of either type.

187
00:10:42,470 --> 00:10:51,560
And we want this to be
the 4th type A failure.

188
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,940
Now, if that is the 4th
type A failure, what does

189
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:59,330
that mean for the previous
11 failures before that?

190
00:10:59,330 --> 00:11:01,370
That means out of
the previous 11,

191
00:11:01,370 --> 00:11:08,670
there were 3 A failures
out of 11 total failures.

192
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,800
So the probability
that we need to find

193
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:13,350
is just exactly equal
to the probability

194
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:21,370
that we have 3 A failures
out of the first 11

195
00:11:21,370 --> 00:11:31,270
and that the 12th
failure was also type A.

196
00:11:31,270 --> 00:11:32,490
OK.

197
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:40,880
Now, what is the probability
that out of 11, 3 of them

198
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:43,590
were of type A?

199
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:46,600
Well, that is just a binomial,
because every single time

200
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,580
we choose a new bulb, it's
either type A or type B.

201
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:53,600
And we said at the beginning
that each of these choices

202
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:54,740
are independent.

203
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:58,410
And so if you think of
choosing type A as a success,

204
00:11:58,410 --> 00:12:04,080
this is just the probability of
3 successes out of 11 trials.

205
00:12:04,080 --> 00:12:10,440
And then we also need the 12th
trial to be a success as well.

206
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:13,300
So combining that,
we get that we

207
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,610
have a binomial
for the first 11.

208
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:23,080
So we need 3 out of the
first 11 to be successes.

209
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:26,480
And the probability of
success is just 1/2.

210
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:34,610
And then we also need the 12th
trial to be a success as well.

211
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,260
And we can simplify this.

212
00:12:36,260 --> 00:12:40,880
This is just 11 choose 3
times 1/2 to the 12th power.

213
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,680

214
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,920
All right.

215
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:50,210
Part (f)-- part (f)
asks a question that

216
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,690
looks very similar to
what part (e) asked.

217
00:12:52,690 --> 00:12:54,970
Except the difference is
that now we want to know,

218
00:12:54,970 --> 00:12:59,335
what is the probability that
out of the first 12 failures,

219
00:12:59,335 --> 00:13:09,721
4 of them were of type A bulbs--
so 4 A out of the first 12.

220
00:13:09,721 --> 00:13:11,220
So you'll notice
the difference here

221
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:16,010
is that now the
4th type A failure

222
00:13:16,010 --> 00:13:20,650
is no longer fixed to
be the 12 total failure.

223
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:23,830
This 4th type A failure
could have happened earlier.

224
00:13:23,830 --> 00:13:28,340
So for example, it could
have been that the first 4

225
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,650
bulbs were all type
A. And the last 8

226
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:33,350
were all type B. That's
possible now under part (f).

227
00:13:33,350 --> 00:13:37,470
But it was not possible
under part (e).

228
00:13:37,470 --> 00:13:40,430
So now this is actually a
simpler problem to solve,

229
00:13:40,430 --> 00:13:42,130
because all we
care about now it's

230
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:45,650
just 4 successes out of 12.

231
00:13:45,650 --> 00:13:53,220
So that probability is just 12
choose 4 times 1/2 to the 4th,

232
00:13:53,220 --> 00:13:54,090
1/2 to the 8th.

233
00:13:54,090 --> 00:13:58,770

234
00:13:58,770 --> 00:14:04,720
And so, that simplifies to 12
choose 4 times 1/2 to the 12th.

235
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:07,630

236
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,770
In part (h), we want to find
the probability that two type B

237
00:14:10,770 --> 00:14:14,710
bulbs combined last longer
than one type A bulb.

238
00:14:14,710 --> 00:14:18,600
Type B bulbs last for an
exponentially distributed

239
00:14:18,600 --> 00:14:20,750
amount of time with parameter 3.

240
00:14:20,750 --> 00:14:23,990
And all times are
independent from one type B

241
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:26,196
bulb to another type B bulb.

242
00:14:26,196 --> 00:14:30,210
And so when you have two
of them put together,

243
00:14:30,210 --> 00:14:34,440
it's just adding two IID
exponential random variables.

244
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:37,220
And so let's define
random variable

245
00:14:37,220 --> 00:14:46,090
Y to be the time of two B bulbs.

246
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:50,690
And because it's adding
two IID exponentials,

247
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:53,480
we have an Erlang
random variable.

248
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:57,360
And it has order 2 because
we're adding two exponentials.

249
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:01,790
And the parameter is the same as
the parameter of the underlying

250
00:15:01,790 --> 00:15:04,320
exponential, which is 3.

251
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:08,510
And given that, we can write
what the PDF of this Erlang is.

252
00:15:08,510 --> 00:15:19,000
So fY [of] y is 9y e to the
minus 3y, for y greater than 0.

253
00:15:19,000 --> 00:15:26,590
And we can do the same
thing for one type A bulb.

254
00:15:26,590 --> 00:15:44,490
Let's call that T. T is the time
that 1 type A bulb stays lit.

255
00:15:44,490 --> 00:15:48,130
And that is just exponential
with parameter 1.

256
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:50,360
And so we know what that
distribution is as well.

257
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:58,790
It's e to the minus t for t
greater than or equal to 0.

258
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:00,750
And so what we're
asked to do now

259
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,020
is really just find the
probability that one of these

260
00:16:03,020 --> 00:16:04,240
is greater than the other.

261
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,940
And we want the probability
that two B bulbs

262
00:16:07,940 --> 00:16:09,640
last longer than one A bulb.

263
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,020
So we can write that
as the probability

264
00:16:12,020 --> 00:16:18,520
that T is less than Y.

265
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:21,460
And to find what
that probability is,

266
00:16:21,460 --> 00:16:22,810
we can condition.

267
00:16:22,810 --> 00:16:30,010
So let's condition on
Y being some little y.

268
00:16:30,010 --> 00:16:33,290
So there's that
conditional probability.

269
00:16:33,290 --> 00:16:38,400
Then we multiply that by the
density of Y at that little y

270
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:39,470
and integrate.

271
00:16:39,470 --> 00:16:43,880
And we should integrate
from 0 to infinity,

272
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,886
because that's the
range of values for Y.

273
00:16:50,886 --> 00:16:51,780
OK.

274
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,920
So what does that equal?

275
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:56,480
Well, the first
thing we can do is

276
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:58,710
we can replace this
random variable capital

277
00:16:58,710 --> 00:17:05,040
Y with some number little y,
because we are conditioning

278
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:07,430
on Y being equal to little y.

279
00:17:07,430 --> 00:17:09,790
And the second thing we can
do to simplify this is we

280
00:17:09,790 --> 00:17:11,690
can actually remove
this conditioning.

281
00:17:11,690 --> 00:17:14,550
And the reason for
that is T and Y

282
00:17:14,550 --> 00:17:19,849
are independent, because T is
related to the duration of type

283
00:17:19,849 --> 00:17:23,950
A bulbs and Y is related to
the duration of type B bulbs.

284
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:26,660
And we're told in the
problem that these durations

285
00:17:26,660 --> 00:17:28,525
are independent.

286
00:17:28,525 --> 00:17:31,930
And so we can get rid
of this conditioning.

287
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:34,930
And now we just have this.

288
00:17:34,930 --> 00:17:39,070
So to proceed, let's fill in
what these probabilities are.

289
00:17:39,070 --> 00:17:41,630
What is the probability
that random variable T

290
00:17:41,630 --> 00:17:42,930
is less than y?

291
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:47,770
Well, that is just a CDF of
T. And T is an exponential.

292
00:17:47,770 --> 00:17:50,560
And so we know that the
CDF of an exponential

293
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:55,000
is just 1 minus e to
the minus lambda t.

294
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:59,980
In this case, it's going to
be 1 minus e to the minus y,

295
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,610
because lambda is 1.

296
00:18:01,610 --> 00:18:04,610

297
00:18:04,610 --> 00:18:08,100
And then we can also just
substitute in what the PDF of y

298
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:09,570
is from earlier.

299
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:15,970
It's 9y e to the minus 3y dy.

300
00:18:15,970 --> 00:18:18,520
And so the rest of
this is just calculus.

301
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,840
And if we finish
the calculation,

302
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:24,380
we will get that the
probability is 7/16.

303
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:27,330

304
00:18:27,330 --> 00:18:29,467
So that's one way of
doing this problem.

305
00:18:29,467 --> 00:18:31,050
And so far, we
actually haven't really

306
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:34,050
seen a Poisson
process appear yet.

307
00:18:34,050 --> 00:18:37,160
So let's try to come up with
another method of solving

308
00:18:37,160 --> 00:18:40,300
this problem using
Poisson processes.

309
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,790
And there's a natural
link, because we're

310
00:18:42,790 --> 00:18:45,610
talking about light
bulbs that die out

311
00:18:45,610 --> 00:18:48,140
according to exponential
random variables.

312
00:18:48,140 --> 00:18:49,930
And that has a
natural connection

313
00:18:49,930 --> 00:18:52,180
to Poisson processes.

314
00:18:52,180 --> 00:18:55,130
So let's imagine this is time 0.

315
00:18:55,130 --> 00:19:01,480
And here is how long the
first light bulb lasts.

316
00:19:01,480 --> 00:19:03,990
And we can consider
this an arrival.

317
00:19:03,990 --> 00:19:06,150
So an arrival we can
think of as just a bulb

318
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,590
dying and being
replaced by new one.

319
00:19:08,590 --> 00:19:11,920
And these inter-arrival
times are exponential.

320
00:19:11,920 --> 00:19:15,680
And moreover, they're
independent from one

321
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:16,930
inter-arrival time to another.

322
00:19:16,930 --> 00:19:20,070
And so we do have a
Poisson [process].

323
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:25,770
So let's say this is when the
next one dies out, and so on.

324
00:19:25,770 --> 00:19:29,960
So how can we solve this problem
now with the Poisson process?

325
00:19:29,960 --> 00:19:32,460
Let's imagine that
we were having

326
00:19:32,460 --> 00:19:37,020
a race starting at time 0.

327
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:42,400
We have a race between type
A bulbs and two type B bulbs.

328
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,400
So they start off
at the same time.

329
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:52,240
And we want to see which
arrival comes later.

330
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,835
So we want a scenario
like this, for example.

331
00:19:57,835 --> 00:19:59,335
If we consider a
scenario like this,

332
00:19:59,335 --> 00:20:02,920
this means that the
one single type A bulb

333
00:20:02,920 --> 00:20:07,320
lasted for this long, which was
longer than two type B bulbs

334
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:09,710
combined.

335
00:20:09,710 --> 00:20:12,940
And so how can we come up
with the probability now?

336
00:20:12,940 --> 00:20:16,141
What we can do is we can
merge these two processes.

337
00:20:16,141 --> 00:20:18,640
And we can merge them because
they're both Poisson processes

338
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,730
and they are independent,
because the arrivals

339
00:20:22,730 --> 00:20:25,392
or how long the
inter-arrival is for type

340
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,700
A bulbs, which is how
long type A bulbs last,

341
00:20:27,700 --> 00:20:29,825
is independent of how
long type B bulbs last.

342
00:20:29,825 --> 00:20:31,450
And so these processes
are independent.

343
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,770
We can merge them.

344
00:20:33,770 --> 00:20:39,260
And so let's say we have some
arrivals in the merged process.

345
00:20:39,260 --> 00:20:43,630
Now, in the type A process,
what is the arrival rate?

346
00:20:43,630 --> 00:20:49,460
The arrival rate is type A
bulb's lambda, which is 1.

347
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:53,120
And for B, it's type B
bulb's lambda, which is 3.

348
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:59,580
And so in the combined,
we get a lambda of 4.

349
00:20:59,580 --> 00:21:01,810
And so now how do
we actually come up

350
00:21:01,810 --> 00:21:04,300
with an answer for
this probability?

351
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,760
Let's consider the
complement of this event.

352
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:10,340
So let's consider
T being greater

353
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:14,150
than Y, which means that the
first of the single A bulb

354
00:21:14,150 --> 00:21:17,046
lasts longer than both B bulbs.

355
00:21:17,046 --> 00:21:20,040
Now, how does that occur
here in the merged process?

356
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,140
What that corresponds
to is exactly

357
00:21:22,140 --> 00:21:26,190
the case where we
have the first two

358
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,000
arrivals in the merged process
both are of type B bulbs.

359
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,530

360
00:21:32,530 --> 00:21:34,140
So if that is the
case, that means

361
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:40,325
that first, a type B bulb
died and then the second B

362
00:21:40,325 --> 00:21:40,960
bulbs died.

363
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:44,500
And the type A bulb
still hasn't died yet,

364
00:21:44,500 --> 00:21:47,800
which means that it has
outlasted both of these.

365
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,944
Now, what is the probability
of this happening?

366
00:21:49,944 --> 00:21:51,360
Well, we know what
the probability

367
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,400
of an arrival in the merged
process being from the type B

368
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,310
process.

369
00:21:56,310 --> 00:22:00,120
That is equal to--
in general, it's

370
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:04,910
lambda B over lambda A plus
lambda B. So in this case,

371
00:22:04,910 --> 00:22:05,620
it's 3/4.

372
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:09,040

373
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:13,020
Now, so what's the probability
of having a B followed by a B?

374
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:14,470
Well, these are independent.

375
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:20,020
And so the probability is just
3/4 squared, which is 9/16.

376
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,830

377
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:26,760
That gives you the probability
that the type A bulb

378
00:22:26,760 --> 00:22:28,260
lasts longer than
the type B bulb.

379
00:22:28,260 --> 00:22:32,400
And notice that it could be the
case that the very next arrival

380
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,670
was type A, in which case the
one type A bulb lasted longer

381
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:37,630
than both of them.

382
00:22:37,630 --> 00:22:42,315
Or it could also be the case
that there were more type B

383
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:45,600
bulb arrivals until
the first type A bulb.

384
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,640
But it doesn't matter.

385
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,620
As long as the first
two were both type B,

386
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,650
that guarantees that the single
type A bulb lasted longer.

387
00:22:54,650 --> 00:22:56,900
So that, what we just
found, is the probability

388
00:22:56,900 --> 00:23:01,644
9/16 is the probability
that T is greater than Y.

389
00:23:01,644 --> 00:23:03,810
So to find the probability
that Y is greater than T,

390
00:23:03,810 --> 00:23:05,140
we just subtract that from 1.

391
00:23:05,140 --> 00:23:06,590
And when we subtract
that from 1,

392
00:23:06,590 --> 00:23:11,120
we get that it is also
the same answer-- 7/16.

393
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,340
So that's just another
way of calculating

394
00:23:13,340 --> 00:23:15,810
the same probability.

395
00:23:15,810 --> 00:23:19,340
In part (i), we're told that the
process stops after exactly 12

396
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,420
total bulb failures
have occurred.

397
00:23:21,420 --> 00:23:24,860
And we're asked to find,
how much of that time

398
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:27,305
was illuminated by type B bulbs?

399
00:23:27,305 --> 00:23:32,320

400
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:34,780
So let's define some
random variables.

401
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:40,320
Let's call V the
quantity that we actually

402
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,395
want to find, the total
time from type B bulbs.

403
00:23:46,395 --> 00:23:49,850

404
00:23:49,850 --> 00:23:52,280
So in order to
find that, we also

405
00:23:52,280 --> 00:23:55,900
need to know, out of those
12 bulbs that were used,

406
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:59,490
how many were
actually of type B?

407
00:23:59,490 --> 00:24:02,780
Because each time we choose
either A or B randomly.

408
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:14,240
So the number of B bulbs
out of the 12 total bulbs

409
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:17,700
is also a quantity of interest.

410
00:24:17,700 --> 00:24:31,970
And finally, let's let Yi be
the time of the i-th B bulb.

411
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:38,000
So how long did the i-th B
bulb out of these 12 last?

412
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,590
All right.

413
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:43,565
So given that, what we know is
that V,the total time from B

414
00:24:43,565 --> 00:24:52,410
bulbs out of these 12 is going
to be a sum of these individual

415
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:56,830
times from each
individual B bulb.

416
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:59,980
And it's the sum of Yi
from i equals 1 to N.

417
00:24:59,980 --> 00:25:02,340
But notice that N itself
is a random variable.

418
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:05,410
So what we have is a
sum of a random number

419
00:25:05,410 --> 00:25:07,980
of random variables.

420
00:25:07,980 --> 00:25:09,620
And what the problem
asks us to find

421
00:25:09,620 --> 00:25:14,070
is the expected value
and variance of V.

422
00:25:14,070 --> 00:25:17,730
So what is the expected value?

423
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:23,000
The expected value-- we
can apply essentially,

424
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:24,320
iterated expectation.

425
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:27,920
And we know that for a
sum of a random number

426
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:30,300
of random variables,
where each one

427
00:25:30,300 --> 00:25:33,080
of the individual random
variables is IID--

428
00:25:33,080 --> 00:25:37,130
and that's true, because for
all B bulbs, the amount of time

429
00:25:37,130 --> 00:25:41,970
that they last is exponentially
distributed with parameter 3.

430
00:25:41,970 --> 00:25:43,560
So they are all IID.

431
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:47,140
So in this case, we get
that this expectation

432
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:52,380
is equal to the expectation of
N times the expectation of Yi.

433
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:54,430
So what it's essentially
saying is that,

434
00:25:54,430 --> 00:25:57,230
on average, how many
B bulbs do you have?

435
00:25:57,230 --> 00:25:59,430
And then multiply
that by, on average,

436
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:01,240
how long each B bulb lasts.

437
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:04,000
And that will give you
the total average time.

438
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,350
And so what is that?

439
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:08,750
What is the average number
of B bulbs that you get?

440
00:26:08,750 --> 00:26:11,310
Well, you choose 12.

441
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:14,170
Out of 12, you want to
know how many of those

442
00:26:14,170 --> 00:26:15,210
were type B bulbs.

443
00:26:15,210 --> 00:26:18,410
But type A and type B bulbs
are chosen equally likely.

444
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:24,150
So on average, 6 out of these
12 will be type B bulbs.

445
00:26:24,150 --> 00:26:27,920
And each one is exponential
with parameter 3.

446
00:26:27,920 --> 00:26:31,480
And so the expectation of an
exponential is 1 over lambda.

447
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:34,110
And so this is 1/3.

448
00:26:34,110 --> 00:26:38,740
So the answer is 2 in this case.

449
00:26:38,740 --> 00:26:43,650
Now, for the variance, we
can go through the steps

450
00:26:43,650 --> 00:26:45,400
and use the law
of total variance.

451
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:48,390
But for the special
case of the sum

452
00:26:48,390 --> 00:26:50,330
of a random number
of random variables,

453
00:26:50,330 --> 00:26:55,880
we have a simpler
formula, which is,

454
00:26:55,880 --> 00:26:58,160
it's equal to the
expectation of N times

455
00:26:58,160 --> 00:27:06,850
the variance of Yi plus the
expectation of Yi quantity

456
00:27:06,850 --> 00:27:12,450
squared times the variance of
N. And so you see that there's

457
00:27:12,450 --> 00:27:15,530
two components of this variance.

458
00:27:15,530 --> 00:27:17,380
One component of
the variance comes

459
00:27:17,380 --> 00:27:21,440
from randomness within
how long each bulb lasts.

460
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:24,030
And the other one comes
from randomness with respect

461
00:27:24,030 --> 00:27:26,700
to how many B bulbs
there actually are.

462
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,017
And when you combine
both of them suitably,

463
00:27:29,017 --> 00:27:30,350
then you get the total variance.

464
00:27:30,350 --> 00:27:34,100
And so in this case,
expectation of N is again 6.

465
00:27:34,100 --> 00:27:35,620
Variance of Yi is
the variance of

466
00:27:35,620 --> 00:27:39,710
an exponential with
parameter lambda equals 3.

467
00:27:39,710 --> 00:27:42,896
And that is equal to
1 over lambda squared.

468
00:27:42,896 --> 00:27:47,505
And so this is 1/9.

469
00:27:47,505 --> 00:27:52,984
The expectation of
exponential Yi is 1/3.

470
00:27:52,984 --> 00:27:54,150
Square that and you get 1/9.

471
00:27:54,150 --> 00:27:57,730
And the variance of
N is the variance

472
00:27:57,730 --> 00:28:00,830
of the number of
B bulbs out of 12.

473
00:28:00,830 --> 00:28:04,510
And so that N is actually
a binomial random variable,

474
00:28:04,510 --> 00:28:07,480
because it's the number of
successes out of 12, where

475
00:28:07,480 --> 00:28:10,470
success is a B
bulb being chosen.

476
00:28:10,470 --> 00:28:13,200
And the probability of
success for each trial is 1/2.

477
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:18,430
And so for a binomial, the
variance is n times p times 1

478
00:28:18,430 --> 00:28:19,430
minus p.

479
00:28:19,430 --> 00:28:24,120
In this case, it's 12 times
1/2 times 1/2, which is 3.

480
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:27,440

481
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:32,650
And so what we get in the
end-- it's 6/9 plus 3/9.

482
00:28:32,650 --> 00:28:34,090
And that equals 1.

483
00:28:34,090 --> 00:28:36,920

484
00:28:36,920 --> 00:28:39,330
In part (j), we're given
that there are no failures

485
00:28:39,330 --> 00:28:42,190
until some time little t.

486
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,860
And conditioned on
that, we now want

487
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:46,360
to find the
conditional expectation

488
00:28:46,360 --> 00:28:49,085
of the duration of the first
bulb given that information.

489
00:28:49,085 --> 00:28:52,820

490
00:28:52,820 --> 00:28:54,670
So let's draw a picture.

491
00:28:54,670 --> 00:28:57,200
Here is time 0.

492
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,620
Here some t.

493
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:02,510
And what we're told is that
there are no failures from here

494
00:29:02,510 --> 00:29:04,960
until here-- so no failures.

495
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,930

496
00:29:08,930 --> 00:29:12,330
Now, what we want
to know is how long

497
00:29:12,330 --> 00:29:15,130
the first bulb lasts
given that information.

498
00:29:15,130 --> 00:29:19,040
So what we can see
here is that it

499
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:21,840
seems like we can apply
the memoryless property

500
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,640
of the exponential to help us.

501
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:26,930
So for review, suppose
that random variable X

502
00:29:26,930 --> 00:29:31,330
is exponentially distributed
with some parameter lambda.

503
00:29:31,330 --> 00:29:38,110
And suppose we know that X
is at least some little t.

504
00:29:38,110 --> 00:29:41,390
And given that, we want to know
what the expectation of X is.

505
00:29:41,390 --> 00:29:46,510
So what we know now is that, we
know that it's lasted until t.

506
00:29:46,510 --> 00:29:47,930
So it's at least that big.

507
00:29:47,930 --> 00:29:50,300
And from the
memoryless property,

508
00:29:50,300 --> 00:29:51,940
we know that going
forward starting

509
00:29:51,940 --> 00:29:56,030
from t, the additional
time after t

510
00:29:56,030 --> 00:29:58,409
will also be
exponentially distributed

511
00:29:58,409 --> 00:29:59,700
with the same parameter lambda.

512
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:03,380
So it's as if it's
starting over anew.

513
00:30:03,380 --> 00:30:05,650
And so this
conditional expectation

514
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:10,440
is actually going to be the
expectation of X plus t.

515
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:14,930
So you know it's
lasted t already.

516
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:19,070
And then it's going to last an
additional expectation of X.

517
00:30:19,070 --> 00:30:24,350
And so that's going to
be 1 over lambda plus t.

518
00:30:24,350 --> 00:30:26,039
And so let's try to apply that.

519
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:28,080
But we have to be a little
bit more careful here,

520
00:30:28,080 --> 00:30:35,060
because in our case, knowledge
of how long the first bulb has

521
00:30:35,060 --> 00:30:37,030
lasted also gives us
some more information

522
00:30:37,030 --> 00:30:39,220
about which type of bulb it was.

523
00:30:39,220 --> 00:30:42,320
Because type A bulbs
last longer, on average,

524
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:43,540
than type B bulbs.

525
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:48,950
So if t is large, then that
gives us more confidence

526
00:30:48,950 --> 00:30:51,810
that this bulb is
actually of type A, which

527
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:57,652
will affect how long it will
last subsequently after time t.

528
00:30:57,652 --> 00:31:02,230
And so this problem (j)
will be a combination

529
00:31:02,230 --> 00:31:08,000
of using the memoryless
property plus some inference

530
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:10,780
about whether it was type A
or type B. So in part (a),

531
00:31:10,780 --> 00:31:13,820
we already calculated
what the expectation

532
00:31:13,820 --> 00:31:16,720
of random variable T1,
where T1 is defined

533
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:24,170
to be the duration
of the first bulb.

534
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:24,670
All right.

535
00:31:24,670 --> 00:31:29,480
So in part one, we
calculated the expectation

536
00:31:29,480 --> 00:31:32,170
of T1 unconditioned
on anything else.

537
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:35,980
But now, we want to calculate
the conditional expectation,

538
00:31:35,980 --> 00:31:40,210
the expectation of T1 given
that T1 is greater than t.

539
00:31:40,210 --> 00:31:44,380
So if you remember, in part
(a), the way we did this was we

540
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:47,140
used total expectation and
split it up into two cases--

541
00:31:47,140 --> 00:31:50,170
one where the first bulb
is of type A and another

542
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:52,280
where the first
bulb is of type B.

543
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,680
And we can do the
same thing here.

544
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:58,255
So we can split this up into
the conditional expectation

545
00:31:58,255 --> 00:32:04,424
of T1 given T1 is greater than
t and the first bulb is type A.

546
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,590
And then we have to multiply
that by the probability

547
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:09,160
that it's actually a type A.
But another difference here

548
00:32:09,160 --> 00:32:11,260
is that, remember, we're
in the conditional world

549
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,220
that T1 is greater than t.

550
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:16,930
So this probability also
has to be conditioned on T1

551
00:32:16,930 --> 00:32:19,250
being greater than t.

552
00:32:19,250 --> 00:32:27,120
And we have a similar
expression for the case

553
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:34,130
where it's a bulb of type B.

554
00:32:34,130 --> 00:32:35,520
All right.

555
00:32:35,520 --> 00:32:38,620
So now, let's figure out what
this conditional expectation

556
00:32:38,620 --> 00:32:42,430
is, the conditional expectation
T1, given that it's at least t

557
00:32:42,430 --> 00:32:45,210
and it's of type
A. So now that we

558
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,420
know that it's of
type A, that has

559
00:32:47,420 --> 00:32:50,460
fixed what distribution T1 has.

560
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:55,290
T1 now we know is exponentially
distributed with parameter 1.

561
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:59,350
So now we can go back to
this memoryless property

562
00:32:59,350 --> 00:33:00,730
and use what we found there.

563
00:33:00,730 --> 00:33:04,150
So this is, in fact,
equal now to the t

564
00:33:04,150 --> 00:33:09,730
that we know it's lasted already
plus an additional expectation

565
00:33:09,730 --> 00:33:14,340
of an exponential
with parameter 1.

566
00:33:14,340 --> 00:33:16,250
So it's t plus 1.

567
00:33:16,250 --> 00:33:20,460
Or we can also get that from
here-- 1 over lambda plus t.

568
00:33:20,460 --> 00:33:23,110
Now, what is the probability
that it's actually a type A,

569
00:33:23,110 --> 00:33:28,690
given that it has
lasted until time t?

570
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,750
Well, that we've also
already calculated.

571
00:33:30,750 --> 00:33:33,560
We calculated that in part (c).

572
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:36,870
And from that, from part
(c), the answer that we got

573
00:33:36,870 --> 00:33:45,260
was 1/2 e to the minus t over
1/2 e to the minus t plus 1/2

574
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,500
e to the minus 3t.

575
00:33:46,500 --> 00:33:50,059

576
00:33:50,059 --> 00:33:51,520
OK.

577
00:33:51,520 --> 00:33:53,000
And now, let's do
the second one.

578
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:56,490
What is the expectation of
T1, given that it's at least t

579
00:33:56,490 --> 00:33:57,930
and that it's a type B bulb?

580
00:33:57,930 --> 00:34:00,280
Well, now, given
that it's type B,

581
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:03,700
T1 has been fixed to be an
exponential with parameter 3.

582
00:34:03,700 --> 00:34:07,530
And so this conditional
expectation is t plus 1/3.

583
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:10,350

584
00:34:10,350 --> 00:34:14,810
And the probability that it's
B, given T1 is greater than t

585
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:16,960
is just 1 minus
this probability,

586
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,250
because it has to
be either A or B.

587
00:34:19,250 --> 00:34:23,980
So 1 minus this expression
here is just 1/2 e

588
00:34:23,980 --> 00:34:31,442
to the minus 3t over 1/2
e to the minus t plus 1/2

589
00:34:31,442 --> 00:34:32,610
e to the minus 3t.

590
00:34:32,610 --> 00:34:35,460

591
00:34:35,460 --> 00:34:39,380
And we are essentially done,
because this is the answer.

592
00:34:39,380 --> 00:34:45,219
We can simplify it a little
bit and write it as, t plus 1/3

593
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:52,620
plus 2/3 times 1/2 e to
the minus t over 1/2 e

594
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:58,450
to the minus t plus
1/2 e to the minus 3t.

595
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,960
So if we can group
this like that,

596
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:04,670
what we know is that given
that it's lasted until t,

597
00:35:04,670 --> 00:35:08,440
we know that the total
time is at least t.

598
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,120
Plus, there's going to
be more, on average,

599
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:13,290
depending on what
type of bulb it is.

600
00:35:13,290 --> 00:35:16,620
So if it's a type B
bulb, then we know,

601
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:21,520
on average, it will
last an extra 1/3.

602
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:23,390
And if it's a type
A bulb, we know

603
00:35:23,390 --> 00:35:25,200
it's going to last an extra 1.

604
00:35:25,200 --> 00:35:28,080
So regardless, on average, it's
going to last an extra 1/3.

605
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:30,020
And then if it's
a type A bulb, it

606
00:35:30,020 --> 00:35:33,275
will last an extra 2/3 on
top of that, on average.

607
00:35:33,275 --> 00:35:36,100
And so that gives
us the final answer.

608
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:39,070
So in this problem,
we've covered

609
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,120
a lot of different
parts in problems

610
00:35:42,120 --> 00:35:45,380
related to Poisson processes.

611
00:35:45,380 --> 00:35:49,680
And we started out with
looking at the perspective

612
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,450
of exponential random variables.

613
00:35:51,450 --> 00:35:54,630
And then we tried to relate
that to a Poisson process.

614
00:35:54,630 --> 00:35:58,000
And in the end, we also combined
some elements of inference

615
00:35:58,000 --> 00:35:58,500
as well.

616
00:35:58,500 --> 00:35:59,890
So I hope that was helpful.

617
00:35:59,890 --> 00:36:02,040
And see you next time.
