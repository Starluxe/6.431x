2
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:03,800
In this lecture, we introduce
the Poisson process, which is

3
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:07,320
a continuous time analog of
the Bernoulli process.

4
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:10,690
One way of thinking about
it is as follows.

5
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:14,610
Time is continuous, but
conceptually we divide it into

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:16,640
a very large number of slots.

7
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:19,090
And during each slot,
we have a tiny

8
00:00:19,090 --> 00:00:21,240
probability of an arrival.

9
00:00:21,240 --> 00:00:23,570
This probability is proportional
to the

10
00:00:23,570 --> 00:00:25,610
length of the slot.

11
00:00:25,610 --> 00:00:28,150
Furthermore, we have an
independence assumption for

12
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:29,400
the different slots.

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:31,860

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:35,560
The Poisson process is a very
elegant model of arrival

15
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,870
processes in continuous time.

16
00:00:37,870 --> 00:00:40,850
It models many real-world
phenomena.

17
00:00:40,850 --> 00:00:44,390
And it also has a very clean
mathematical structure that

18
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,970
allows us to calculate
practically

19
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:50,300
every quantity of interest.

20
00:00:50,300 --> 00:00:53,820
Our development will parallel
our analysis of

21
00:00:53,820 --> 00:00:55,640
the Bernoulli process.

22
00:00:55,640 --> 00:00:59,830
For example, we will find the
PMF of the number of arrivals

23
00:00:59,830 --> 00:01:03,030
during a time interval
and the PDF of the

24
00:01:03,030 --> 00:01:05,930
time of the kth arrival.

25
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:08,950
We will discuss the
memorylessness properties of

26
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:10,900
the Poisson process.

27
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,540
Similar to the case of the
Bernoulli process, this is

28
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:16,450
just a consequence of the
independence assumptions that

29
00:01:16,450 --> 00:01:18,580
we are making.

30
00:01:18,580 --> 00:01:21,530
We will then exploit these
independence properties to

31
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:25,580
argue that the interarrival
times are independent

32
00:01:25,580 --> 00:01:27,950
exponential random variables.

33
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:30,480
And we will conclude with
a comprehensive example.

34
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,730
