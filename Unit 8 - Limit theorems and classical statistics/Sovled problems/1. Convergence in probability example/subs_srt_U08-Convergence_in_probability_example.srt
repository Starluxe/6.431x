1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,380
In this problem, we're given a
random variable X which has a

3
00:00:03,380 --> 00:00:09,980
uniform distribution in the
interval negative 1 to 1.

4
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,030
In other words, if we were to
draw out the PDF of X, we see

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:19,290
that in the interval negative
1 to 1, it has value 1/2.

6
00:00:19,290 --> 00:00:22,460

7
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:23,720
Now we're given a
sequence [of]

8
00:00:23,720 --> 00:00:29,320
random variables X1, X2, and so
on, where each Xi has the

9
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,240
same distribution as X and
different Xi's are

10
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:35,480
independent.

11
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:38,820
For part (a), we would like
to know if the sequence Xi

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:41,070
converges to some number--

13
00:00:41,070 --> 00:00:42,390
let's call it c--

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:48,100
in probability as i
goes to infinity--

15
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:49,710
whether this is true.

16
00:00:49,710 --> 00:00:52,030
Let's first recall the
definition of convergence in

17
00:00:52,030 --> 00:00:53,410
probability.

18
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:57,900
If this does happen, then by
definition, we'll have that

19
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:05,660
for every epsilon greater than
0, the probability Xi minus c

20
00:01:05,660 --> 00:01:06,030
greater [than or]

21
00:01:06,030 --> 00:01:11,510
equal to epsilon, this quantity
will go to 0 in the

22
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:15,490
limit of i going to infinity.

23
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:20,450
In other words, with very high
probability, we will find Xi

24
00:01:20,450 --> 00:01:24,220
to be very concentrated around
the number c if this were to

25
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:28,580
be the PDF of Xi.

26
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,430
Now, can this be true?

27
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:34,740
Well, we know that each Xi is
simply a uniform distribution

28
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,380
over negative 1 to 1.

29
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:38,790
It doesn't really change
as we increase i.

30
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,420
So intuitively, the
concentration around any

31
00:01:41,420 --> 00:01:43,840
number c is not going
to happen.

32
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,980
So we should not expect
convergence in probability in

33
00:01:47,980 --> 00:01:49,050
this sense.

34
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,250
For part (b), we would like to
know whether the sequence Yi,

35
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:58,370
defined as Xi divided by i,
converges to anything in

36
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,050
probability.

37
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:04,250
Well, by just looking at the
shape of Yi, we know that

38
00:02:04,250 --> 00:02:09,340
since the absolute value of Xi
is less than 1, then we expect

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:14,380
the absolute value of
Yi is less than 1/i.

40
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:17,400
So eventually, Yi gets
very close to 0

41
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:19,450
as i goes to infinity.

42
00:02:19,450 --> 00:02:23,650
So it's safe to bet that maybe
Yi will converge to 0 in

43
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:26,400
probability.

44
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,870
Let's see if this is
indeed the case.

45
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,155
The probability of Yi minus
0 greater [than or]

46
00:02:33,155 --> 00:02:38,860
equal to epsilon is equal to the
probability of Yi absolute

47
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:39,570
value greater [than or]

48
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,440
equal to epsilon.

49
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,020
Now, previously we know that the
absolute value of Yi is at

50
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,270
most 1/i by the definition
of Yi.

51
00:02:49,270 --> 00:02:53,000
And hence the probability right
here is upper bounded by

52
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,690
the probability of 1/i
greater [than or]

53
00:02:55,690 --> 00:02:57,370
equal to epsilon.

54
00:02:57,370 --> 00:02:59,740
Notice in this expression,
there is nothing random.

55
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:01,410
i is simply a number.

56
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:08,030
Hence this is either 1 if
i is less [than or]

57
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:15,700
equal to 1/epsilon, or 0 if i
is greater than 1/epsilon.

58
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:20,520
Now, this tells us, as long as
i is great enough-- it's big

59
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:22,720
enough compared to epsilon--

60
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:25,500
we know that this quantity
here is 0.

61
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:30,782
And that tells us in the limit
[as] i goes to infinity, [the]

62
00:03:30,782 --> 00:03:35,910
probability of Yi deviating
from 0 by more than

63
00:03:35,910 --> 00:03:40,070
epsilon goes to 0.

64
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:47,080
And that shows that indeed, Yi
converges to 0 in probability

65
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:51,100
because the expression right
here, this limit, holds for

66
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,180
all epsilon.

67
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:55,400
Now, in the last part of the
problem, we are looking at a

68
00:03:55,400 --> 00:04:01,100
sequence Zi defined by Xi raised
to the i-th power.

69
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:03,940
Again, since we know Xi is some
number between negative 1

70
00:04:03,940 --> 00:04:07,380
and 1, this number raised to the
i-th power is likely to be

71
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:08,630
very small.

72
00:04:08,630 --> 00:04:10,760
And likely to be small in the
sense that it will have

73
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:12,830
absolute value close to 0.

74
00:04:12,830 --> 00:04:16,660
So a safe guess will be the
sequence Zi converges to 0 as

75
00:04:16,660 --> 00:04:20,500
well as i goes to infinity.

76
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,490
How do we prove this formally?

77
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,810
We'll start again with a
probability that Zi stays away

78
00:04:26,810 --> 00:04:31,970
from 0 by more than epsilon
and see how that evolves.

79
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:36,770
And this is equal to the
probability that Xi raised to

80
00:04:36,770 --> 00:04:38,090
the i-th power [is]

81
00:04:38,090 --> 00:04:38,460
greater [than or]

82
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:40,920
equal to epsilon.

83
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:46,330
Or again, we can write this by
taking out the absolute value,

84
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:47,960
that Xi is less [than or]

85
00:04:47,960 --> 00:04:51,780
equal to negative epsilon raised
to the 1 over i-th

86
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:55,280
power or Xi greater [than or]

87
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,710
equal to epsilon [to the]

88
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:01,470
1 over i-th power.

89
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,610
So here, we'll divide into two
cases, depending on the value

90
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:07,000
of epsilon.

91
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:10,670
In the first case, epsilon
is greater than 1.

92
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:15,130
Well, if that's the case, then
we know epsilon raised to some

93
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:18,590
positive power is still
greater than 1.

94
00:05:18,590 --> 00:05:22,760
But again, Xi cannot have any
positive density beyond the

95
00:05:22,760 --> 00:05:25,470
interval negative 1 or 1.

96
00:05:25,470 --> 00:05:28,650
And hence we know the
probability above, which is Xi

97
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:31,780
less than some number smaller
than negative 1 or greater

98
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:34,720
than some number bigger
than 1 is 0.

99
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,910
So that case is handled.

100
00:05:36,910 --> 00:05:40,210
Now let's look at a case where
epsilon is less than 1,

101
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,870
greater than 0.

102
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,010
So in this case, epsilon to the
1/i will be less than 1.

103
00:05:47,010 --> 00:05:50,380
And it's not that difficult
to check that since Xi has

104
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:55,280
uniform density between negative
1 and 1, of magnitude

105
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,490
1/2, then the probability
here [will simply be]

106
00:05:59,490 --> 00:06:07,590
2 times 1/2 times the distance
between epsilon to the 1 over

107
00:06:07,590 --> 00:06:11,390
i-th power and 1.

108
00:06:11,390 --> 00:06:15,080
So in order to prove this
quantity converges to 0, we

109
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:19,200
simply have to justify why
does epsilon to the 1/i

110
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:23,570
converge to 1 as i
goes to infinity.

111
00:06:23,570 --> 00:06:25,120
For that, we'll recall
properties

112
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,560
of exponential functions.

113
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,910
In particular, if a is a
positive number and x is its

114
00:06:30,910 --> 00:06:35,920
exponent, if we were to take the
limit as x goes to 0 and

115
00:06:35,920 --> 00:06:39,370
look at the value of a to the
power of x, we see that

116
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:41,190
this goes to 1.

117
00:06:41,190 --> 00:06:46,920
So in this case, we let a be
equal to epsilon and x be

118
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,640
equal to 1/i.

119
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:52,450
As we can see that as i goes to
infinity, the value of x,

120
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:55,070
which is 1/i, does go to 0.

121
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:59,540
And therefore, in the limit of i
going to infinity, the value

122
00:06:59,540 --> 00:07:04,500
of epsilon to the 1 over
i-th power goes to 1.

123
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:09,380
And that shows if we plug this
limit into the expression

124
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:13,860
right here that indeed, the term
right here goes to 0 as i

125
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:15,150
goes to infinity.

126
00:07:15,150 --> 00:07:20,740
And all in all, this implies the
probability of Zi minus 0

127
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,740
absolute value greater
[than or]

128
00:07:21,740 --> 00:07:26,290
equal to epsilon, in the limit
of i going to infinity,

129
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:30,370
converges to 0 for all
positive epsilon.

130
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:34,230
And that completes our proof
that indeed, Zi converges to 0

131
00:07:34,230 --> 00:07:35,480
in probability.

132
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:36,080
