1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,810

2
00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:03,200
In this exercise, we'll be
working with the notion of

3
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:06,100
convergence in probability, as
well as some other notion of

4
00:00:06,100 --> 00:00:07,670
convergence of random
variables that

5
00:00:07,670 --> 00:00:09,810
we'll introduce later.

6
00:00:09,810 --> 00:00:14,930
First type of random variable
is Xn, where Xn has

7
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:26,080
probability 1 minus 1 over n to
be as 0 and probability of

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,010
1 over n to be a 1.

9
00:00:28,010 --> 00:00:30,776

10
00:00:30,776 --> 00:00:37,230
And graphically, we see that we
have a pretty big mass, at

11
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:42,470
1 minus 1 over n, at location
0, and a tiny bit somewhere

12
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,040
here, only 1 over n.

13
00:00:45,040 --> 00:00:52,330
So this will be the PMF for X.

14
00:00:52,330 --> 00:00:54,110
On the other hand, we
have the sequence of

15
00:00:54,110 --> 00:00:56,890
random variables, Yn.

16
00:00:56,890 --> 00:01:00,410
Fairly similar to Xn with
a slight tweak.

17
00:01:00,410 --> 00:01:04,410
The similar part says it also
has a very high probability of

18
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:08,230
being at 0, mass [1
minus 1 over n].

19
00:01:08,230 --> 00:01:12,670
But on the off chance that Yn
is not at 0, it has a pretty

20
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,080
big value n.

21
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,810
So it has probability 1 over
n of somewhere out there.

22
00:01:17,810 --> 00:01:21,800
So to contrast the two graphs,
we see at 0, they have the

23
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:26,400
same amount of mass, [1 minus 1
over n], but for Y, it's all

24
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:29,820
the way out there that has
a small mass 1 over n.

25
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:33,260
So this will be our P Yn of y.

26
00:01:33,260 --> 00:01:37,770

27
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:40,180
And for the remainder of the
problem, we'll be looking at

28
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:44,980
the regime where the number n
tends to infinity, and study

29
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,990
what will happen to these two
sequences of random variables.

30
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,690
In part (a), we're to compute
the expected value and

31
00:01:52,690 --> 00:01:55,230
variance for both Xn and Yn.

32
00:01:55,230 --> 00:01:56,650
Let's get started.

33
00:01:56,650 --> 00:02:03,330
The expected value of Xn is
given by the probability--

34
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:08,669
it's at one, which is 1 over n
times 1 plus the probability

35
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:09,894
being at 0, [1 minus]

36
00:02:09,894 --> 00:02:12,670
1 over n times value 0.

37
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:15,920
And that gives us 1 over n.

38
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,550
To calculate the variance of
Xn, see that variance is

39
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:27,280
simply the expected value of Xn
minus expected value of Xn,

40
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,890
which in this case is 1 over n
from the previous calculation

41
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,130
we have here.

42
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,490
We take the square of this value
and compute the whole

43
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:44,560
expectation, and this gives us
1 over n, 1 minus 1 over n

44
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:45,970
plus the [remaining]

45
00:02:45,970 --> 00:02:52,000
probability 1 over 1 minus n of
X being at 0, so 0 minus 1

46
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,250
over n squared.

47
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,560

48
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,310
And if we carry out the
calculations here, we'll get n

49
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,730
minus 1 over n squared.

50
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:10,440

51
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,080
Now, let's turn to Yn.

52
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:17,530
The expected value of Yn is
equal to probability of being

53
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:25,270
at 0, 0 plus the probability
of being at n and

54
00:03:25,270 --> 00:03:27,000
times the value n.

55
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,060
And this gives us 1.

56
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,274
The variance of Yn.

57
00:03:33,274 --> 00:03:39,840
We do the same thing as before,
we have 1 minus 1 over

58
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:44,950
n probability of being at 0,
multiplied 0 minus 1 squared,

59
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:50,490
where 1 is the expected value
of Y. And with probability 1

60
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:56,310
over n, out there, equal to n,
and this is multiplied by n

61
00:03:56,310 --> 00:03:58,620
minus 1 squared.

62
00:03:58,620 --> 00:04:02,560
And this gives us n minus 1

63
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,070
Already, we can see that while
the expected value for X was 1

64
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:11,490
over n, the expected value for
Y is sitting right at 1.

65
00:04:11,490 --> 00:04:15,400
It does not decrease
as n increases.

66
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:20,310
And also, while the variance
for X is n minus 1 over n

67
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,860
squared, the variance for
Y is much bigger.

68
00:04:23,860 --> 00:04:27,930
It is actually increasing to
infinity as n goes infinity.

69
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,180
So this intuition will be
helpful for the remainder of

70
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,370
the problem.

71
00:04:31,370 --> 00:04:34,490
In part (b), we're asked to use
Chebyshev's Inequality and

72
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:38,660
see whether Xn or Yn converges
to any number in probability.

73
00:04:38,660 --> 00:04:41,430
Let's first recall what the
inequality is about.

74
00:04:41,430 --> 00:04:46,020
It says that if we have random
variable X, in our case, Xn,

75
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:51,500
then the probability of Xn minus
the expected value of

76
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:57,040
Xn, in our case, 1 over n,
that this deviation, the

77
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,380
absolute value of this
difference is greater than

78
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:08,290
epsilon is bounded above by the
variance of Xn divided by

79
00:05:08,290 --> 00:05:11,290
the value of epsilon squared.

80
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:16,100
Well, in our case, we know the
variance is n minus 1 over n

81
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:22,300
squared, hence this whole term
is this term divided by

82
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:24,530
epsilon squared.

83
00:05:24,530 --> 00:05:27,700
Now, we know that as n gets
really big, the probability of

84
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,100
Xn being at 0 is very big.

85
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,270
It's 1 minus 1 over n.

86
00:05:32,270 --> 00:05:35,750
So a safe bet to guess is that
if Xn were to converge

87
00:05:35,750 --> 00:05:38,590
anywhere on the real line,
it might just converge

88
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:39,940
to the point 0.

89
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:41,940
And let's see if that is true.

90
00:05:41,940 --> 00:05:45,860
Now, to show that Xn converges
to 0 in probability, formally

91
00:05:45,860 --> 00:05:50,800
we need to show that for every
fixed epsilon greater than 0,

92
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:58,600
the probability that Xn minus 0
greater than epsilon has to

93
00:05:58,600 --> 00:06:02,690
be 0, in the limit has
n going to infinity.

94
00:06:02,690 --> 00:06:05,660
And hopefully, the inequalities
above will help

95
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,480
us achieve this goal.

96
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:09,350
And let's see how
that is done.

97
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:12,860
I would like to have an
estimate, in fact, an upper

98
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:17,790
bound of the probability Xn
absolute value greater [than]

99
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,040
or equal to epsilon.

100
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:21,850
And now, we're going to do
some massaging to this

101
00:06:21,850 --> 00:06:25,730
equation so that it looks like
what we know before, which is

102
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,990
right here.

103
00:06:27,990 --> 00:06:33,420
Now, we see that this equation
is in fact, less than

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:38,376
probability Xn minus 1
over n greater [than]

105
00:06:38,376 --> 00:06:42,000
or equal to epsilon
plus 1 over n.

106
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:45,180
Now, I will justify this
inequality in one second.

107
00:06:45,180 --> 00:06:48,490
But suppose that you believe me
for this inequality, we can

108
00:06:48,490 --> 00:06:53,020
simply plug-in the value right
here, namely substituting

109
00:06:53,020 --> 00:06:57,560
epsilon plus 1 over n, in the
place of epsilon right here

110
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:00,880
and use the Chebyshev Inequality
we did earlier to

111
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:05,060
arrive at the following
inequality, which is n minus 1

112
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,840
over n squared times, instead
of epsilon, now we have

113
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,955
epsilon plus 1 over n squared.

114
00:07:12,955 --> 00:07:16,710

115
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,280
Now, if we take n to
infinity in this

116
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:22,410
equation, see what happens.

117
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:27,230
Well, this term here converges
to 0 because n squared is much

118
00:07:27,230 --> 00:07:29,490
bigger than n minus 1.

119
00:07:29,490 --> 00:07:32,180
And this term here converges
to number 1

120
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:34,650
over epsilon squared.

121
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:38,420
So it becomes 0 times 1 over
epsilon squared, hence the

122
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,830
whole term converges to 0.

123
00:07:40,830 --> 00:07:46,640
And this proves that indeed, the
limit of the term here as

124
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:47,100
n [goes]

125
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:53,610
to infinity is equal to 0, and
that implies Xn converges to 0

126
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:54,860
in probability.

127
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:58,810

128
00:07:58,810 --> 00:08:01,050
Now, there is the one thing
I did not justify in the

129
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:06,650
process, which is why is
probability of absolute value

130
00:08:06,650 --> 00:08:12,460
Xn greater than epsilon less
than the term right here?

131
00:08:12,460 --> 00:08:14,480
So let's take a look.

132
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:18,080
Well, the easiest way to see
this is to see what ranges of

133
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,010
Xn are we talking about
in each case.

134
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:26,220
Well, in the first case, we're
looking at interval around 0

135
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:30,850
plus minus epsilon and Xn
can lie anywhere here.

136
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,539

137
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:36,740
While in the second case, right
here, we can see that

138
00:08:36,740 --> 00:08:41,440
the set of range values for Xn
is precisely this interval

139
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:45,280
here, which was the same as
before, but now, we actually

140
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:49,810
have less on this side, where
the starting point and the

141
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:54,720
interval on the right is
epsilon plus 2 over n.

142
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,890
And therefore, the right hand
side captures strictly less

143
00:08:58,890 --> 00:09:02,390
values of Xn than the left
hand side, hence the

144
00:09:02,390 --> 00:09:04,820
inequality is true.

145
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:07,490
Now, we wonder if we can use
the same trick, Chebyshev

146
00:09:07,490 --> 00:09:10,870
Inequality, to derive a
result for Yn as well.

147
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,390
Let's take a look.

148
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:17,370
The probability of Yn minus its
mean, 1, greater [than]

149
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:19,490
or equal to epsilon.

150
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:25,700
From the Chebyshev Inequality,
we have variance of Yn divided

151
00:09:25,700 --> 00:09:28,420
by epsilon squared.

152
00:09:28,420 --> 00:09:29,410
Now, there is a problem.

153
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,420
The variance of Yn
is very big.

154
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:34,510
In fact, it is equal
to n minus 1.

155
00:09:34,510 --> 00:09:37,870
And we calculated in part (a),
divided by epsilon squared.

156
00:09:37,870 --> 00:09:41,670
And this quantity here
diverges as n [goes]

157
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:45,360
to infinity to infinity
itself.

158
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,810
So in this case, the Chebyshev
Inequality does not tell us

159
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:54,220
much information of whether
Yn converges or not.

160
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:58,420
Now, going to part (c), the
question is although we don't

161
00:09:58,420 --> 00:10:02,030
know anything about Yn from just
the Chebyshev Inequality,

162
00:10:02,030 --> 00:10:04,660
does Yn converge to
anything at all?

163
00:10:04,660 --> 00:10:07,520
Well, it turns out it does.

164
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:09,270
In fact, we don't have to
go through anything more

165
00:10:09,270 --> 00:10:10,330
complicated than [the]

166
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:12,830
distribution Yn itself.

167
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:16,980
So from the distribution of
Yn, we know that absolute

168
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:21,620
value of Yn greater or equal to
epsilon is equal to 1 over

169
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:25,135
n whenever epsilon
is less than n.

170
00:10:25,135 --> 00:10:30,150
And this is true because we know
Yn has a lot of mass at 0

171
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:36,320
and a tiny bit of mass, of value
1 over n, at location n.

172
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:39,670
So if we draw the cutoff here
at epsilon, then the

173
00:10:39,670 --> 00:10:44,420
probability of Yn landing to the
right of epsilon is simply

174
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,250
equal to 1 over n.

175
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:49,800
And this tells us, if we take
the limit of n going to

176
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:54,640
infinity and measure the
probability that Yn--

177
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:55,870
just to write it clearly--

178
00:10:55,870 --> 00:11:00,800
deviates from 0 by more than
epsilon, this is equal to the

179
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:02,380
limit as n [goes]

180
00:11:02,380 --> 00:11:04,600
to infinity of 1 over n.

181
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:07,560
And that is equal to 0.

182
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:12,270
From this calculation, we know
that Yn does converge to 0 in

183
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:15,730
probability, as n [goes]

184
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,980
to infinity.

185
00:11:16,980 --> 00:11:20,350

186
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:24,430
For part (d), we'd like to know
whether the convergence

187
00:11:24,430 --> 00:11:28,970
in probability implies the
convergence in expectation.

188
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:32,170
That is, if we have a sequence
of random variables, let's

189
00:11:32,170 --> 00:11:39,450
call it Zn, that converges to
[a] number c in probability,

190
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:40,100
as n [goes]

191
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:45,960
to infinity, does it also imply
that the limit as n

192
00:11:45,960 --> 00:11:46,170
[goes]

193
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:52,930
to infinity of the expected
value of Zn also

194
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:55,180
converges to c.

195
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:56,250
Is that true?

196
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:59,520
Well, intuitively it is true,
because in the limit, Zn

197
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:02,890
almost looks like it
concentrates on c solely,

198
00:12:02,890 --> 00:12:06,530
hence we might expect that the
expected value is also going

199
00:12:06,530 --> 00:12:08,040
to c itself.

200
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:10,430
Well, unfortunately, that
is not quite true.

201
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:14,580
In fact, we have the proof right
here by looking at Yn.

202
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:19,140
For Yn, we know that the
expected value of Yn is equal

203
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:21,210
to 1 for all n.

204
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,840
It does not matter
how big n gets.

205
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:28,900
But we also know from part (c)
that Yn does converge to 0 in

206
00:12:28,900 --> 00:12:31,200
probability.

207
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,180
And this means somehow Yn can
get very close to 0, yet its

208
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:39,500
expected value still
stays one away.

209
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,220
And the reason again, we go
back to the way Yn was

210
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:43,710
constructed.

211
00:12:43,710 --> 00:12:47,810
Now, as n goes to infinity, the
probability of Yn being at

212
00:12:47,810 --> 00:12:52,960
0, 1 minus 1 over
n, approaches 1.

213
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:58,740
So it's very likely that Yn is
having a value 0, but whenever

214
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:02,600
on the off chance that Yn takes
a value other than 0,

215
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:03,640
it's a huge number.

216
00:13:03,640 --> 00:13:08,560
It is n, even though it has a
small probability of 1 over n.

217
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:11,110
Adding these two factors
together, it tells us the

218
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:15,320
expected value of Yn
always stays at 1.

219
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:18,460
And however, in probability,
it's very likely

220
00:13:18,460 --> 00:13:21,100
that Y is around 0.

221
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:24,070
So this example tells us
convergence in probability is

222
00:13:24,070 --> 00:13:25,020
not that strong.

223
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:28,010
It tells us something about the
random variables but it

224
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,420
does not tell us whether the
mean value of the random

225
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:34,150
variables converge to
the same number.

226
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,400
