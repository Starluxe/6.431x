1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,080

2
00:00:01,080 --> 00:00:03,030
In this problem, we're going
to look at how to use the

3
00:00:03,030 --> 00:00:06,170
Central Limit Theorem to
estimate the probability of

4
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,080
making the wrong decision.

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:10,730
And the decision that we're
trying to make in this problem

6
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:14,880
is to decide whether or not a
roulette wheel at the casino

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,470
is fair or not.

8
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:20,690
So a roulette is just the game
at the casino where there are

9
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:23,310
a bunch of numbers on a wheel.

10
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:26,810
You spin the wheel, you throw a
ball onto the wheel, and you

11
00:00:26,810 --> 00:00:30,300
bet on which number the ball
is going to land on.

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:33,420
So in this case, we're going to
deal with a wheel with 36

13
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:35,450
numbers, 1 through 36.

14
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:41,820
And we're going to try to tell
whether or not this roulette

15
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:43,900
wheel is fair.

16
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:44,790
OK.

17
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:48,640
So the way we're going to do
that is we're going to observe

18
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,425
what number the ball lands
on for 100 times.

19
00:00:52,425 --> 00:00:56,220

20
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,130
We're going to look at how many
times out of those 100,

21
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:02,540
the ball lands on
an odd number.

22
00:01:02,540 --> 00:01:05,960
So there's half odd numbers,
half even numbers.

23
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,000
And if it's fair, we would
expect that about 50 times out

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,970
of 100, it'll land
on an odd number.

25
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:16,240
And so our decision rule is
going to be if more than 55

26
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,450
out of the 100 times, the ball
lands on an odd number, we're

27
00:01:19,450 --> 00:01:23,750
going to say that the roulette
wheel is not fair.

28
00:01:23,750 --> 00:01:24,500
OK.

29
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:27,380
And now, what we want to know
is, given that rule, what's

30
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,180
the probability that we'll make
a wrong mistake, meaning

31
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:36,240
that more than 55 times out of
100, the ball lands on an odd

32
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,260
number, but in fact,
the roulette

33
00:01:38,260 --> 00:01:40,220
wheel actually is fair?

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:40,740
OK.

35
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:43,260
So what we're going to do is
we're going to assume that the

36
00:01:43,260 --> 00:01:46,200
roulette wheel is fair, meaning
that all the 36

37
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:50,920
numbers are equally likely
to be landed on.

38
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:53,200
And we're going to test, or
we're going to try to

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,060
calculate, what the probability
of making a

40
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,550
mistake is.

41
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,594
So let's define a random
variable let's call it S,

42
00:02:00,594 --> 00:02:11,860
where S is number of times you
get an odd number out of 100.

43
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:20,210
And so we assume, also, that
each of the times you play

44
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:22,910
this game, it's independent.

45
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:27,640
And so what we have is that
this is just the number of

46
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,030
times you have success, where we
can define success as being

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,080
you get an odd number.

48
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:43,120
And so then S is just a binomial
random variable,

49
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,660
where you have 100 trials, and
the probability of success on

50
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:50,570
each trial, because we assume
that the roulette wheel is

51
00:02:50,570 --> 00:02:53,700
fair, is 1/2--

52
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,040
50/50 chance of getting an odd
versus an even number.

53
00:02:58,040 --> 00:03:01,890
And so because of that, we
know from binomial random

54
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:07,760
variables that the expectation
is just n times p.

55
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:10,570
n is 100. p is 0.5 here.

56
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,160
So you expect to get
50 odd numbers.

57
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:21,150
And the standard deviation
of S--

58
00:03:21,150 --> 00:03:26,110
for a binomial, it's the square
root of np 1 minus p.

59
00:03:26,110 --> 00:03:30,010
In this case, it's 100
times 1/2 times 1/2.

60
00:03:30,010 --> 00:03:32,940
So it's the square root of 25.

61
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:36,210
So the standard deviation
is 5.

62
00:03:36,210 --> 00:03:44,390
And now, if you actually
wanted to calculate the

63
00:03:44,390 --> 00:03:46,500
probability that you'll
make an error--

64
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:49,000
well, how do you make an
error in this case?

65
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,690
We assume that the roulette
wheel is fair.

66
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:56,180
So in that case, you'll make
an error if you actually do

67
00:03:56,180 --> 00:04:00,110
get more than 55 odd numbers.

68
00:04:00,110 --> 00:04:01,760
And what is the probability
of that?

69
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,750
The probability which you're
looking for is the probability

70
00:04:04,750 --> 00:04:07,580
that S is greater than 55.

71
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,690
If this event occurs, then you
will make a mistake, because

72
00:04:11,690 --> 00:04:15,340
you will say that the roulette
wheel is not fair, when, in

73
00:04:15,340 --> 00:04:16,913
fact, it is.

74
00:04:16,913 --> 00:04:17,360
OK.

75
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,680
So how do you calculate this?

76
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:26,210
Well, you can calculate it using
the actual binomial PMF.

77
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,310
And what it'll amount to
is a big summation.

78
00:04:31,310 --> 00:04:35,520
So it'll be the summation of--

79
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:48,670
you have to get anywhere between
56 to 100 odd numbers.

80
00:04:48,670 --> 00:04:56,990
For each one of those, there
is 100 choose k orders in

81
00:04:56,990 --> 00:05:01,430
which those k odd numbers can
appear out of the 100 trials.

82
00:05:01,430 --> 00:05:06,260
And then you have the
probability of success is 1/2.

83
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,640
The probability of failure
is also 1/2.

84
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,990
And so because of that,
it just simplifies

85
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:12,670
to 1/2 to the 100.

86
00:05:12,670 --> 00:05:15,070
So this is just the standard
binomial PMF.

87
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:18,470
And you just take
this summation.

88
00:05:18,470 --> 00:05:20,660
Now, this is kind
of complicated.

89
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,880
So what we're going to do is
look for an approximation to

90
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,160
this using Central
Limit Theorem.

91
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:25,570
All right.

92
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,630
So there are different
ways of doing this.

93
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:30,180
And we'll actually go through
three different

94
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:31,410
ways of doing this.

95
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:35,110
The first one is--

96
00:05:35,110 --> 00:05:39,440
well, the probability that we're
looking for is this.

97
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,250
And so we do the standard
converting

98
00:05:43,250 --> 00:05:46,470
to a standard normal.

99
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:50,190
So what we do is we
subtract the mean.

100
00:05:50,190 --> 00:05:52,990
We subtract the mean and
divide by the standard

101
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,000
deviation on both sides.

102
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,940

103
00:06:00,940 --> 00:06:06,140
And then we invoke the Central
Limit Theorem.

104
00:06:06,140 --> 00:06:10,020
And we say that this is
approximately the probability

105
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:14,640
that Z, the standard normal,
is greater than--

106
00:06:14,640 --> 00:06:25,030
well, 5 over 5 is 1, which
is just 1 minus Phi of 1.

107
00:06:25,030 --> 00:06:31,160
And if you go in the standard
normal tables, you can find

108
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,330
out what Phi of 1 is.

109
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:36,860
It turns out it's 0.8413.

110
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:43,210
And so the approximation that
you get here is 0.1587.

111
00:06:43,210 --> 00:06:48,730
So this is your approximate
probability of being wrong--

112
00:06:48,730 --> 00:06:50,880
saying that the roulette
wheel is unfair

113
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,710
when, in fact, it is.

114
00:06:53,710 --> 00:06:54,430
OK.

115
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:58,540
So notice that we've actually
used 55 here

116
00:06:58,540 --> 00:07:01,320
with this strict equality.

117
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:05,160
Because S is a binomial, this is
fine, because it turns out

118
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,410
that this probability that S is
strictly greater than 55 is

119
00:07:11,410 --> 00:07:15,010
exactly the same as the
probability that S is greater

120
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,990
than or equal to 56.

121
00:07:16,990 --> 00:07:20,360
Because S a binomial,
it's discrete.

122
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:22,160
It takes only integer values.

123
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,900
It can't be anything
between 55 and 56.

124
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:27,670
So these are actually
the same.

125
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:33,190
So we can take that and now use
56 in our Central Limit

126
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,300
Theorem approximation.

127
00:07:35,300 --> 00:07:43,850
So what that tells us is now,
we can rewrite it as this--

128
00:07:43,850 --> 00:07:47,655
56 minus the mean over the
standard deviation.

129
00:07:47,655 --> 00:07:52,410

130
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:58,050
Now, because when we take this
conversion and invoke the

131
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:00,980
Central Limit Theorem, what
we'll get is that this is

132
00:08:00,980 --> 00:08:03,580
approximately the probability
that Z is greater than or

133
00:08:03,580 --> 00:08:09,410
equal to 6 over 5, or 1.2.

134
00:08:09,410 --> 00:08:15,170
And this is again, of course,
1 minus Phi of 1.2.

135
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:18,870
And then if you look at the
tables again, this is

136
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,680
approximately 0.1151.

137
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,986
So with 55, we got 0.1587.

138
00:08:28,986 --> 00:08:33,100
With 56, we got 0.1151.

139
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,320
They're not too different.

140
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:39,720
But there is a fairly
significant percentage change

141
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,299
between the two.

142
00:08:41,299 --> 00:08:43,539
So which one is right?

143
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,720
Or is there an even
better way, some

144
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,650
kind of middle ground?

145
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,799
And that is exactly the
third way of doing it.

146
00:08:51,799 --> 00:08:56,320
And this is also the de
Moivre-Laplace approximation

147
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:57,360
to the binomial.

148
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:02,190
So instead of taking just
strictly either of the two

149
00:09:02,190 --> 00:09:06,810
integer values, 55 or 56, what
we do is we take the middle

150
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:11,820
ground, and we say that, well,
let's instead approximate this

151
00:09:11,820 --> 00:09:23,480
with the probability that Z is
greater than 55.5 minus the

152
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:26,860
mean over the standard
deviation.

153
00:09:26,860 --> 00:09:29,210
So that would give us--

154
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:34,840
this is 1 minus, now,
Phi of 1.1.

155
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:37,110
5.5 over 5 is 1.1.

156
00:09:37,110 --> 00:09:43,330
And if you look at the tables,
this will give you 0.1357.

157
00:09:43,330 --> 00:09:45,765
So we have three candidate
answers.

158
00:09:45,765 --> 00:09:49,290

159
00:09:49,290 --> 00:09:50,310
This is the biggest.

160
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:51,020
This is the smallest.

161
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:53,360
And this is in between.

162
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:58,630
So it turns out that if you
actually calculate out this

163
00:09:58,630 --> 00:10:02,310
summation, the exact answer--

164
00:10:02,310 --> 00:10:06,070
or the exact answer at least
to four decimal places--

165
00:10:06,070 --> 00:10:10,940
is 0.1356.

166
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:11,955
This is without any
approximations.

167
00:10:11,955 --> 00:10:15,010
You actually calculate the exact
probability using the

168
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:16,720
binomial distribution.

169
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:20,970
And you can see that the midway
point approximation,

170
00:10:20,970 --> 00:10:23,710
the de Moivre-Laplace
approximation, is very close

171
00:10:23,710 --> 00:10:26,390
to the exact answer.

172
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:32,690
And so this is, in general, the
case, especially when n is

173
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:36,000
large and p is roughly
equal to 1/2.

174
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:38,840
So when you have roughly
balanced binomial distribution

175
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:43,180
with enough samples, then
using this midway point

176
00:10:43,180 --> 00:10:44,860
approximation will be
better than using

177
00:10:44,860 --> 00:10:47,020
either of the two endpoints.

178
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:47,480
OK.

179
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,400
So this is just an example of
applying the Central Limit

180
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:54,210
Theorem, and specifically
applying it to the binomial

181
00:10:54,210 --> 00:10:54,830
distribution.

182
00:10:54,830 --> 00:10:57,570
And you can see that there's
different ways of doing it.

183
00:10:57,570 --> 00:11:01,160
And in some cases, using the
midpoint approximation gives

184
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,242
you a better approximation.

185
00:11:03,242 --> 00:11:03,580
OK.

186
00:11:03,580 --> 00:11:05,760
I hope that was interesting,
and see you next time.

187
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:07,010
