00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,320

2
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:01,430
Hi.

3
00:00:01,430 --> 00:00:03,370
In this video, we're going
to do some approximate

4
00:00:03,370 --> 00:00:07,300
calculations using the central
limit theorem.

5
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:09,876
We're given that Xn is the
number of gadgets produced on

6
00:00:09,876 --> 00:00:11,590
day n by a factory.

7
00:00:11,590 --> 00:00:14,600
And it has a normal
distribution, with mean 5 and

8
00:00:14,600 --> 00:00:15,910
variance 9.

9
00:00:15,910 --> 00:00:19,780
And they're all independent and
identically distributed.

10
00:00:19,780 --> 00:00:21,470
We're looking for the
probability that the total

11
00:00:21,470 --> 00:00:25,630
number of gadgets in 100
days is less than 440.

12
00:00:25,630 --> 00:00:33,110
To start, we can first write
this as the probability of the

13
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:37,550
sum of the gadgets produced on
each of the 100 days being

14
00:00:37,550 --> 00:00:41,770
less than 440.

15
00:00:41,770 --> 00:00:45,340
Notice that this is the sum of
a large number of independent

16
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:46,520
random variables.

17
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,820
So we can use the central limit
theorem and approximate

18
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:53,330
the sum as a normal
random variable.

19
00:00:53,330 --> 00:00:56,240
Then we'd basically, in order
to compute this probability,

20
00:00:56,240 --> 00:00:59,250
we'd basically need to
standardize this and then use

21
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,900
the standard normal table.

22
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:02,940
So let's first compute
the expectation and

23
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,390
variance of the sum.

24
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,840
So I'm going to actually sum
up from 1 to n, instead of

25
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,250
100, to do it more generally.

26
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:21,150
So the linearity is preserved
for the expectation operator.

27
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:24,120
So this is the sum of
the expected values.

28
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:27,570
And since they're all
identically distributed, they

29
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:30,750
all have the same expectation,
and there are n of them.

30
00:01:30,750 --> 00:01:34,696
And so we have this
being n times 5.

31
00:01:34,696 --> 00:01:42,280
For the variance of the sum,
it's also the sum of the

32
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:48,160
variances because of
the independence.

33
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,050
And so they're identically
distributed to be n times the

34
00:01:51,050 --> 00:01:53,030
variance of Xi.

35
00:01:53,030 --> 00:01:58,320
And this is n times 9.

36
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,310
So now, we can standardize
it or make it 0 mean

37
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:04,430
and variance 1.

38
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:09,199
So to do that, you would
take these Xi's,

39
00:02:09,199 --> 00:02:11,050
subtract their mean.

40
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:14,890
It's going to be 5 times
100 of them.

41
00:02:14,890 --> 00:02:19,130
So it's 500 over the square root
of the variance, which is

42
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:21,510
9 times 100 of them.

43
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:23,870
So it's 900.

44
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:34,430
So that's less than 440 minus
500 over square root of 900.

45
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:45,300
So notice that the sum of Xi's
is a discrete quantity.

46
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,850
So it's a discrete
random variable.

47
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:48,675
So it may have a
PMF like this.

48
00:02:48,675 --> 00:02:52,470

49
00:02:52,470 --> 00:02:53,590
And we're trying to
approximate it

50
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:56,050
with a normal density.

51
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:58,220
So this is not drawn to scale.

52
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:04,150
But let's say that this is
440 and this is 439.

53
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,445
Basically, we're trying to say,
what's the probability of

54
00:03:06,445 --> 00:03:07,710
it being less than 440?

55
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:14,870
So it's the probability that
it's 439 or 438 or 437.

56
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,760
But in the continuous case, a
good approximation to this

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:24,000
would be to take the middle,
say 439.5, and compute the

58
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,140
area below that.

59
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:32,010
So in this case, when we do the
normal approximation, it

60
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:36,580
works out better if we use
this half correction.

61
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:40,800
And so this, in this case,
the probability--

62
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,670
let's call Z the standard
normal.

63
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:46,850
And so this is approximately
equal to a standard normal,

64
00:03:46,850 --> 00:03:52,250
with the probability of the
standard normal being less

65
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,880
than whatever that is.

66
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:55,300
If you plug that into
your calculator, you

67
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:59,240
get negative 2.02.

68
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:04,520
So now, if we try to figure out
what this, from the table,

69
00:04:04,520 --> 00:04:07,160
we'll find that negative values
are not tabulated.

70
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:10,815
But we know that
the normal, the

71
00:04:10,815 --> 00:04:11,950
standard normal is symmetric.

72
00:04:11,950 --> 00:04:15,790
And so if we want to compute the
area in this region, it's

73
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,720
the same as the area in
this region above--

74
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:19,480
2.02.

75
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,420
So this is the same as the
probability that Z

76
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:28,050
is bigger than 2.02.

77
00:04:28,050 --> 00:04:31,930
That's just 1 minus the
probability that Z is less

78
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,150
than or equal to 2.02.

79
00:04:34,150 --> 00:04:40,370
And so that's, by definition,
Phi of 2.02.

80
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:45,410
If you look it up on the table,
2.02 has probability

81
00:04:45,410 --> 00:04:48,940
here of 0.9783.

82
00:04:48,940 --> 00:04:50,670
And we can just write that in.

83
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,970
That's the answer
for part (a).

84
00:04:52,970 --> 00:04:59,320

85
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:03,090
So now, for part (b), we're
asked what's the largest n

86
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:09,070
approximately so that
it satisfies this?

87
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:13,330
So again, we can use the central
limit theorem and use

88
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:16,460
similar steps here.

89
00:05:16,460 --> 00:05:22,050
So we have, in this case, for n
greater than or equal to 200

90
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:26,070
plus 5n, and standardize.

91
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:33,360
So we'll have to n.

92
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,540
And the mean here, this where
this comes handy,

93
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:36,400
that's going to be 5n.

94
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:39,910
And the variance is 9n.

95
00:05:39,910 --> 00:05:41,500
It's greater than
or equal to--

96
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:43,780
5n's will cancel when
you subtract.

97
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:48,910
So you get 200 over the
square root of 9n.

98
00:05:48,910 --> 00:05:54,050
And we can again use the half
approximation here, the half

99
00:05:54,050 --> 00:05:57,750
correction here, but I'm not
going to do it to keep the

100
00:05:57,750 --> 00:06:00,270
problem simple.

101
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:06,520
And so in this case, this is
approximately equal to the

102
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:08,530
probability of the standard
normal being greater than or

103
00:06:08,530 --> 00:06:12,920
equal to 200 over square
root of 9n.

104
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:18,620
And so same sort
of thing here--

105
00:06:18,620 --> 00:06:23,180
this is just 1 minus this.

106
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:26,180
The equal sign doesn't matter,
because Z is a continuous

107
00:06:26,180 --> 00:06:27,690
random variable.

108
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:33,840
And so we have this here.

109
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,760
And we want this to be less
than or equal 0.05.

110
00:06:39,760 --> 00:06:46,630
So that means that Phi of 200
over square root of 9 has to

111
00:06:46,630 --> 00:06:49,360
be greater than or
equal to 0.95.

112
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:59,480
So we're basically looking for
something here that ensures

113
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:03,810
that this region is
at least 0.95.

114
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:09,260
So if you look at the table,
0.95 lies somewhere in between

115
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,590
1.64 and 1.65.

116
00:07:12,590 --> 00:07:17,240
And I'm going to use 1.65 to
be conservative, because we

117
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:20,100
want this region to
be at least 0.95.

118
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:23,450
So 1.65 works better here.

119
00:07:23,450 --> 00:07:29,780
And so we want this thing, this
here, which is going to

120
00:07:29,780 --> 00:07:38,710
be 200 over square root
of 9n, to be bigger

121
00:07:38,710 --> 00:07:42,800
than or equal to 1.65.

122
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:50,690
So n here is going to be less
than or equal to 200 over 1.65

123
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:54,040
squared 1 over 9.

124
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,100
So if you plug this into your
calculator, you might have a

125
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,130
decimal in there.

126
00:07:58,130 --> 00:08:02,630
Then we just pick n,
the largest integer

127
00:08:02,630 --> 00:08:04,680
that satisfies this.

128
00:08:04,680 --> 00:08:07,650
So we can plug that into
your calculator.

129
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,220
You'll find that it's
going to be 1632.

130
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:14,450
So that's part (b).

131
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:16,150
Last part--

132
00:08:16,150 --> 00:08:19,330
let n be the first day when the
total number of gadgets is

133
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:21,170
greater than 1,000.

134
00:08:21,170 --> 00:08:23,390
What's the probability
that n is greater

135
00:08:23,390 --> 00:08:24,810
than or equal to 220?

136
00:08:24,810 --> 00:08:28,550
Again, we want to use the
central limit theorem, but the

137
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:35,100
trick here is to recognize that
this is actually equal to

138
00:08:35,100 --> 00:08:41,510
the probability that the sum
from i equals 1 to 219 of Xi

139
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:44,800
is less than or equal
to 1,000.

140
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:47,650
So let's look at both directions
to check this.

141
00:08:47,650 --> 00:08:51,410
If n is greater than or equal
to 220, then this has to be

142
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:55,720
true, because if it weren't
true, and if this were greater

143
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,230
than 1,000, then n would've
been less

144
00:08:58,230 --> 00:09:00,160
than or equal to 219.

145
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:03,650
So this direction works.

146
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,440
The other direction, if this
were the case, it has to be

147
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,290
the case that n is greater than
or equal to 220, because

148
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:14,840
up until 219, it hasn't
exceeded 1,000.

149
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:19,090
And so at some point
beyond that, it's

150
00:09:19,090 --> 00:09:19,970
going to exceed 1,000.

151
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:23,450
And n is going to be greater
than or equal to 220.

152
00:09:23,450 --> 00:09:25,180
So this is the key trick here.

153
00:09:25,180 --> 00:09:33,260
And once you see this, you
realize that this is very

154
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,540
easy, because we do the same
steps as we did before.

155
00:09:37,540 --> 00:09:42,470
So we're looking for this.

156
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:46,373
This is equal to, again, you
do your standardization.

157
00:09:46,373 --> 00:09:49,270

158
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:52,640
So this is from 219.

159
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:58,350
And you get 5 times 219 for the
mean and 9 times 219 for

160
00:09:58,350 --> 00:09:59,070
the variance.

161
00:09:59,070 --> 00:10:06,280
This is less than or equal to
1,000 minus 5 times 219 over

162
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:09,150
square root of 9 times 219.

163
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,940
Again, you can do the
half correction

164
00:10:10,940 --> 00:10:15,030
here, make it 1,000.5.

165
00:10:15,030 --> 00:10:20,000
But I'm not going to do that in
this case, for simplicity.

166
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:23,220
So this is approximately equal
to Z being less than

167
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,620
whatever this is.

168
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:28,530
And if you plug it
in, you find that

169
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:31,410
this is negative 2.14.

170
00:10:31,410 --> 00:10:38,980
So in this case, we have this
is the probability that Z--

171
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:40,860
again, we do the same thing--

172
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:44,300
is greater than or
equal to 2.14.

173
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:49,050
And this is 1 minus the
probability that Z is less

174
00:10:49,050 --> 00:10:53,230
than or equal to 2.14.

175
00:10:53,230 --> 00:11:03,030
And that's just Phi of 2.14,
1 minus Phi of 2.14.

176
00:11:03,030 --> 00:11:07,612
And that's, if you look it up
on the table, it's 2.14.

177
00:11:07,612 --> 00:11:12,160
It's 0.9838.

178
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:13,610
So here's your answer.

179
00:11:13,610 --> 00:11:15,990
So we're done with
part (c) as well.

180
00:11:15,990 --> 00:11:19,770
So in this exercise, we did
a lot of approximate

181
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:23,130
calculations using the central
limit theorem.
