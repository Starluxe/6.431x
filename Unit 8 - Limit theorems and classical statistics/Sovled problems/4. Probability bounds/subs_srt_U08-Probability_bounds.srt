1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:04,710
In this problem, we're given a
collection of 10 variables, X1

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:10,050
through X10, where for each
i, Xi is a uniform random

4
00:00:10,050 --> 00:00:12,345
variable between 0 and 1.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,820
So each [Xi]

6
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,890
is uniform between 0 and 1,
and all 10 variables are

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:19,950
independent.

8
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:26,445
And we'd like to develop a bound
on the probability of

9
00:00:26,445 --> 00:00:34,500
the sum of the 10 variables, 1
to 10, being greater than 7,

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:36,250
using different methods.

11
00:00:36,250 --> 00:00:38,970
So in part (a) we'll
be using the Markov

12
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:41,240
inequality written here.

13
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:44,060
That is, if we have a random
variable, positive random

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:48,350
variable X, the probability X is
greater than a, where a is

15
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:52,480
again some positive number, is
bounded above by the expected

16
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,450
value of X divided by a.

17
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:58,140
And let's see how that works
out in our situation.

18
00:00:58,140 --> 00:01:02,910
In our situation, we will call
X the summation of i equal to

19
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,622
1 to 10 [of]

20
00:01:03,622 --> 00:01:13,350
Xi, and therefore, E of X is
simply 10 times E of X1, the

21
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:16,470
individual ones, and
this gives us 5.

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:21,970
Here we used the linearity of
expectation [so] that the

23
00:01:21,970 --> 00:01:24,530
expectation of the sum of the
random variables is simply the

24
00:01:24,530 --> 00:01:27,020
sum of the expectations.

25
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:29,600
Now, we can invoke Markov's
Inequality.

26
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,630
It says X greater
or equal to 7.

27
00:01:32,630 --> 00:01:42,750
This is less than E of X over 7,
and this gives us 5 over 7.

28
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,780
For part (b), let's see if we
can improve the bound we got

29
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:48,960
in part (a) using the Chebyshev
inequality, which

30
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,950
takes into account the variance
of random variable X.

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:56,700
Again, to refresh you on this,
the Chebyshev Inequality says

32
00:01:56,700 --> 00:02:00,190
the probability that X deviates
from its mean, E of

33
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:05,440
X, by more than a is bound above
by the variance of X

34
00:02:05,440 --> 00:02:08,090
divided by a squared.

35
00:02:08,090 --> 00:02:11,960
So we have to actually do some
work to transform the

36
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:15,680
probability we're interested
in, which is X greater or

37
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:20,140
equal to 7, into the form that's
convenient to use using

38
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:22,430
the Chebyshev Inequality.

39
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:26,510
To do so, we'll rewrite this
probability as the probability

40
00:02:26,510 --> 00:02:29,250
of X minus 5 greater [than]

41
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:33,920
or equal to 2 simply by moving
5 from the right to the left.

42
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,470
The reason we chose 5 is because
5 is equal to the

43
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,660
expected value of X from part
(a) as we know before.

44
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,880
And in fact, this quantity is
also equal to the probability

45
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:49,430
that X minus 5 is less than
or equal to negative 2.

46
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,490

47
00:02:52,490 --> 00:02:55,730
To see why this is true, recall
that X is simply the

48
00:02:55,730 --> 00:03:01,670
summation of the Xi's, the 10
Xi's, and each Xi is a uniform

49
00:03:01,670 --> 00:03:04,370
random variable between
0 and 1.

50
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:08,100
And therefore, each Xi, the
distribution of which is

51
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:11,470
symmetric around its mean 1/2.

52
00:03:11,470 --> 00:03:14,290
So we can see that after we
add up all the Xi's, the

53
00:03:14,290 --> 00:03:16,960
resulting distribution
X is also symmetric

54
00:03:16,960 --> 00:03:19,050
around its mean 5.

55
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:21,840
And as a result, the probability
of X minus 5

56
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,380
greater than 2 is now equal to
the probability that X minus 5

57
00:03:26,380 --> 00:03:28,670
less than negative 2.

58
00:03:28,670 --> 00:03:32,120
And knowing these two, we can
then say they're both equal to

59
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:38,410
1/2 the probability X minus 5
absolute value greater [than]

60
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:41,580
or equal to 2, because this term
right here is simply the

61
00:03:41,580 --> 00:03:44,850
sum of both terms
here and here.

62
00:03:44,850 --> 00:03:48,810

63
00:03:48,810 --> 00:03:51,270
At this point, we have
transformed the probability of

64
00:03:51,270 --> 00:03:51,820
X greater [than]

65
00:03:51,820 --> 00:03:55,350
or equal to 7 into the form
right here, such that we can

66
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:59,090
apply the Chebyshev's Inequality
basically directly.

67
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:02,050
And we'll write the probably
here being less than or equal

68
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,560
to 1/2 times, applying the
Chebyshev Inequality, variance

69
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,510
of X divided by 2 squared.

70
00:04:11,510 --> 00:04:16,589
Now, 2 is the same as a
right here, and this

71
00:04:16,589 --> 00:04:20,230
gives us 1/8 times--

72
00:04:20,230 --> 00:04:24,230
now, the variance of X, we know
is 10 times the variance

73
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:29,220
of a uniform random variable
between 0 and 1, which is

74
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:33,230
1/12, and that gives us 5/48.

75
00:04:33,230 --> 00:04:36,500

76
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,900
Now, let's compare this with
the number we got earlier

77
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:42,650
using the Markov Inequality,
which was 5/7.

78
00:04:42,650 --> 00:04:46,770
We see that 5/48 is much
smaller, and this tells us

79
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,540
that, at least for this example,
using the Chebyshev

80
00:04:49,540 --> 00:04:52,720
Inequality combined with the
information of the variance of

81
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,030
X, we're able to get a stronger
upper bound on the

82
00:04:56,030 --> 00:04:59,150
probability of the event that
we're interested in.

83
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:01,890
Now, in part (b), we saw that
by using the additional

84
00:05:01,890 --> 00:05:04,340
information of the variance
combined with the Chebyshev

85
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,760
Inequality, we can improve
upon the bound given by

86
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:09,650
Markov's Inequality.

87
00:05:09,650 --> 00:05:12,420
Now, in part (c), we'll use
a somewhat more powerful

88
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,230
approach in addition to the
Chebyshev Inequality, the

89
00:05:15,230 --> 00:05:16,910
so-called central
limit theorem.

90
00:05:16,910 --> 00:05:19,450
Let's see if we can even
get a better bound.

91
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:22,600
To remind you what the central
limit theorem is, let's say we

92
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,740
have a summation of i equal
to 1 to some number n of

93
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:30,610
independent and identically
distributed

94
00:05:30,610 --> 00:05:32,420
random variables Xi.

95
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,720
Now, the central limit theorem
says the following.

96
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,770
We take the sum right here,
and subtract out its mean,

97
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:44,890
which is E of the same
summation, and further, we'll

98
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:48,500
divide out, what we call
normalize, by the standard

99
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:50,275
deviation of the summation.

100
00:05:50,275 --> 00:05:55,830
In other words, the square root
of the variance of the

101
00:05:55,830 --> 00:05:56,750
sum of [the]

102
00:05:56,750 --> 00:05:58,000
Xi.

103
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,500

104
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:05,230
So if we perform this procedure
right here, then as

105
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:09,280
the number of terms in the sum
is going to infinity, here as

106
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,550
n goes to infinity, we will
actually see that this random

107
00:06:13,550 --> 00:06:17,610
variable will converge in
distribution in some way that

108
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,960
will eventually look like
a standard normal random

109
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:23,365
variable with mean
0 and [variance]

110
00:06:23,365 --> 00:06:23,880
1.

111
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:26,380
And since we know how the
distribution of a standard

112
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:29,470
normal looks like, we can go
to [a] table and look up

113
00:06:29,470 --> 00:06:32,580
certain properties of the
resulting distribution.

114
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:34,430
So that is a plan to do.

115
00:06:34,430 --> 00:06:36,970
So right now, we have
about 10 variables.

116
00:06:36,970 --> 00:06:40,840
It's not that many compared to
a huge number, but again, if

117
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:43,310
we believe it's a good
approximation, we can get some

118
00:06:43,310 --> 00:06:46,600
information out of it by using
the central limit theorem.

119
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,950
So we are interested in knowing
the probability

120
00:06:48,950 --> 00:06:49,107
[that the]

121
00:06:49,107 --> 00:06:53,060
summation of i equal to 1 to
10 of Xi greater [than]

122
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:55,250
or equal to 7.

123
00:06:55,250 --> 00:06:59,410
We'll rewrite this as 1 minus
the probability the summation

124
00:06:59,410 --> 00:07:06,270
i equal to 1 to 10 of
Xi less equal to 7.

125
00:07:06,270 --> 00:07:08,310
Now, we're going to apply
the scaling to the

126
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:10,570
summation right here.

127
00:07:10,570 --> 00:07:20,050
So this is equal to 1 minus the
probability summation i

128
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:25,880
equal to 1 to 10, Xi minus 5.

129
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,020
Because we know from previous
parts that 5 is the expected

130
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:32,090
value of the sum right
here, and divide by

131
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:36,420
square root of 10/12.

132
00:07:36,420 --> 00:07:40,390
Again, earlier we know that
10/12 is the variance of the

133
00:07:40,390 --> 00:07:41,252
sum of [the]

134
00:07:41,252 --> 00:07:42,340
Xi's.

135
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:45,890
And we'll do the same on the
other side, writing it 7 minus

136
00:07:45,890 --> 00:07:48,930
5 divided by square
root of 10/12.

137
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:52,280

138
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:55,710
Now, if we compute out the
quantity right here, we know

139
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:02,550
that this quantity is roughly
2.19, and by the central limit

140
00:08:02,550 --> 00:08:07,030
theorem, if we believe 10 is a
large enough number, then this

141
00:08:07,030 --> 00:08:13,390
will be roughly equal to 1 minus
the CDF of a standard

142
00:08:13,390 --> 00:08:17,200
normal evaluated at 2.19.

143
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,680
And we can look up the number
in the table, and this gives

144
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:27,910
us a number roughly, 0.014.

145
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,580
Now let's do a quick summary of
what this problem is about.

146
00:08:30,580 --> 00:08:33,280
We're asked to compute the
probability of X greater

147
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:33,440
[than]

148
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,470
or equal to 7, where X is the
sum of 10 uniform random

149
00:08:38,470 --> 00:08:41,850
variables between 0 and
1, which we call Xi.

150
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:44,560
We know that because each
random variable has

151
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,390
expectation 1/2, adding 10
of them up, gives us

152
00:08:48,390 --> 00:08:50,820
expectation of 5.

153
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:54,320
So this is essentially asking,
what is the chance that X is

154
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:57,600
more than two away from
its expectation?

155
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:01,240
So if this is a real line, and
5 is here, maybe X has some

156
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:05,180
distribution around 5, so the
center, or the expected value,

157
00:09:05,180 --> 00:09:09,650
is at 5, we wonder how likely is
it for us to see something

158
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,930
greater than 7.

159
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:16,430
Now, let's see where do we land
on the probably spectrum

160
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,890
from 0 to 1.

161
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,110
Well, without using any
information, we know the

162
00:09:20,110 --> 00:09:23,710
probability cannot be greater
than 1, so a trivial upper

163
00:09:23,710 --> 00:09:27,990
bound for the probability
right here will be 1.

164
00:09:27,990 --> 00:09:31,570
Well, for the first part we use
Markov's Inequality and

165
00:09:31,570 --> 00:09:35,750
that gives us some number, which
is roughly equal to 0.7.

166
00:09:35,750 --> 00:09:36,925
In fact, we got [the]

167
00:09:36,925 --> 00:09:41,590
number 5/7, and this is from
Markov's Inequality.

168
00:09:41,590 --> 00:09:44,300
It's better than 1, already
telling us it cannot be

169
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:48,500
between 0.7 and 1, but
can we do better?

170
00:09:48,500 --> 00:09:51,980
Well, [in] part (b), we see that
all the way, using the

171
00:09:51,980 --> 00:09:52,970
additional information
[on the]

172
00:09:52,970 --> 00:09:57,380
variance, we can get this number
down to 5/48, which is

173
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:59,510
roughly 0.1.

174
00:09:59,510 --> 00:10:01,910
Already, that's much
better than 0.7.

175
00:10:01,910 --> 00:10:03,230
Can we even do better?

176
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:04,880
And this is the Chebyshev.

177
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:06,960
And it turns out we can
indeed do better.

178
00:10:06,960 --> 00:10:09,390
Using the central limit theorem,
we can squeeze this

179
00:10:09,390 --> 00:10:14,370
number all the way down to
0.014, almost a 10 times

180
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,910
improvement over the
previous number.

181
00:10:16,910 --> 00:10:17,530
This is from [the]

182
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:18,630
central limit theorem.

183
00:10:18,630 --> 00:10:22,010
As we can see, by using
different bounding techniques,

184
00:10:22,010 --> 00:10:25,250
we can progressively improve the
bound on the probability

185
00:10:25,250 --> 00:10:28,810
of X exceeding 7, and from this
problem we learned that

186
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:33,480
even with 10 variables, the
truth is more like this, which

187
00:10:33,480 --> 00:10:36,850
says that the distribution of
X concentrates very heavily

188
00:10:36,850 --> 00:10:39,920
around 5, and hence, the
probability of X being greater

189
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:40,080
[than]

190
00:10:40,080 --> 00:10:43,400
or equal to 7 could be much
smaller than one might expect.

191
00:10:43,400 --> 00:10:45,033
