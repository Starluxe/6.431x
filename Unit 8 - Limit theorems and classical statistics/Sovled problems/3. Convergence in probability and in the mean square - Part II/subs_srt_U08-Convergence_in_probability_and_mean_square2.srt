1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,460

2
00:00:01,460 --> 00:00:01,920
For [parts]

3
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:04,300
(e) and (f) of the problem,
we'll be introducing a new

4
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:06,950
notion of convergence, so-called
the convergence in

5
00:00:06,950 --> 00:00:07,160
[the]

6
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:09,260
mean squared sense.

7
00:00:09,260 --> 00:00:13,820
We say that Xn converges
to a number c in [the]

8
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:21,140
mean squared, if as we take n
go to infinity, the expected

9
00:00:21,140 --> 00:00:29,200
value of Xn minus c
squared goes to 0.

10
00:00:29,200 --> 00:00:33,130
To get a sense of what this
looks like, let's say we let c

11
00:00:33,130 --> 00:00:38,740
equal to the expected value of
Xn, and let's say the expected

12
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,940
value of Xn is always
the same.

13
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,060
So the sequence of random
variables has the same mean.

14
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,540
Well, if that is true, then
mean squared convergence

15
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:54,170
simply says the limit of the
variance of Xn is 0.

16
00:00:54,170 --> 00:00:59,370
So as you can imagine, somehow
as n becomes big, the variance

17
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:03,130
of Xn is very small, so
Xn is basically highly

18
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:05,300
concentrated around c.

19
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:10,080
And by this I mean, the density
function for Xn.

20
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,400
So that's the notion
of convergence

21
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:12,940
we'll be working with.

22
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:16,440
Our first task here is to show
that the mean square

23
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,000
convergence is in some sense
stronger than the convergence

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,290
in probability that we have been
working with from part

25
00:01:23,290 --> 00:01:25,000
(a) to part (d).

26
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,580
That is, if I know that Xn
converged to some number c in

27
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:35,110
mean squared, then this must
imply that Xn converges to c

28
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,660
in probability.

29
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,930
And now, we'll show
that for part (e).

30
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:42,560

31
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,400
Well, let's start with a
definition of convergence in

32
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:46,620
probability.

33
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,990
We want to show that for a fixed
constant epsilon the

34
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:55,650
probability that Xn minus
c, greater than epsilon,

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:02:00,990
essentially goes to 0 as
n goes to infinity.

36
00:02:00,990 --> 00:02:03,830
To do so, we look at the
value of this term.

37
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:07,470
Well, the probability of
absolute value Xn minus c

38
00:02:07,470 --> 00:02:11,700
greater than epsilon is equal
to the case if we were to

39
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,150
square both sides of
the inequality.

40
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:19,000
So that is equal to the
probability that Xn minus c

41
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,320
squared greater than
epsilon squared.

42
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,170
We can do this because both
sides are positive, hence this

43
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:28,590
goes through.

44
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,630
Now, to bound this quantity,
we'll invoke the Markov's

45
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:46,970
Inequality, which says this
probability of Xn, some random

46
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:51,420
variable greater than epsilon
squared, is no more than, is

47
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:51,690
less [than or]

48
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,950
equal to the expected value
of the random variable.

49
00:02:56,950 --> 00:03:00,850
In this case, the expected value
of X minus c squared

50
00:03:00,850 --> 00:03:04,890
divided by the threshold that
we're trying to cross.

51
00:03:04,890 --> 00:03:08,530
So that is Markov's
Inequality.

52
00:03:08,530 --> 00:03:12,430
Now, since we know Xn converges
to c in mean

53
00:03:12,430 --> 00:03:15,590
squared, and by definition of
the mean squared we know this

54
00:03:15,590 --> 00:03:19,710
precise expectation right
here goes to 0.

55
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:25,040
And therefore, the whole
expression goes to 0 as n goes

56
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,140
to infinity.

57
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:30,380
Because the denominator here is
a constant and the top, the

58
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:32,920
numerator here, goes to 0.

59
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:34,190
So now we have it.

60
00:03:34,190 --> 00:03:39,760
We know that the probability of
Xn minus c, absolute value,

61
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,630
greater than epsilon goes to 0
as n goes to infinity, for all

62
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:47,660
fixed value of epsilon and
this is the definition of

63
00:03:47,660 --> 00:03:48,910
convergence in probability.

64
00:03:48,910 --> 00:03:55,310

65
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:58,740
Now that we know if Xn converges
to c mean squared,

66
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:02,720
it implies that Xn converges
to c in probability.

67
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,160
One might wonder whether
the reverse is true.

68
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,430
Namely, if we know something
converges in probability to a

69
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:12,080
constant, does the same sequence
of random variables

70
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,820
converge to the same constant
in mean squared?

71
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:17,279
It turns out that is
not quite the case.

72
00:04:17,279 --> 00:04:21,279
The notion of convergence in
probability is not as strong

73
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:25,030
as a notion of convergence
in mean squared.

74
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:27,810
Again, to look for a counter
example, we do not have to go

75
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,410
further than the Yn's we
have been working with.

76
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:38,210
So here we know that Yn
converges to 0 in probability.

77
00:04:38,210 --> 00:04:40,160
But it turns out it does
not converge to

78
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,030
0 in the mean squared.

79
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,520
And to see why this is the case,
we can take the expected

80
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:50,820
value of Yn minus 0 squared,
and see how that goes.

81
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,780
Well, the value of this can be
computed easily, which is

82
00:04:54,780 --> 00:05:01,090
simply 0, if Yn is equal to 0,
with probability 1 minus n,

83
00:05:01,090 --> 00:05:06,800
plus n squared when Yn takes a
value of n, and this happens

84
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,140
with probability 1 over n.

85
00:05:09,140 --> 00:05:13,490
The whole expression evaluates
to n, which blows up to

86
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,780
infinity as n [goes]

87
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:18,400
to infinity.

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:26,490
As a result, the limit n going
to infinity of E of Yn minus 0

89
00:05:26,490 --> 00:05:32,200
squared is infinity and
is not equal to 0.

90
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,580
And there we have it, even
though Yn converges to 0 in

91
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:39,290
probability, because the
variance of Yn, in some sense,

92
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:42,660
is too big, it does
not converge in a

93
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:43,910
mean squared sense.

94
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,167
