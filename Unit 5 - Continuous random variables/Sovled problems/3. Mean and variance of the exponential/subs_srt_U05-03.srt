00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,770

2
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,540
Hi.

3
00:00:01,540 --> 00:00:04,980
In this video, we're going to
compute some useful quantities

4
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:08,520
for the exponential
random variable.

5
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:12,230
So we're given that X is
exponential with rate lambda.

6
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:16,050
The PDF looks like this, and
the formula is here.

7
00:00:16,050 --> 00:00:19,770
First question, part
a, what's the CDF?

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:23,495
So let's go right in.

9
00:00:23,495 --> 00:00:28,350
The CDF of X is the probability
that X is less

10
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:30,590
than or equal to little x.

11
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:33,090
Let's look at some cases here.

12
00:00:33,090 --> 00:00:35,340
What if little x
is less than 0?

13
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:41,670
Well, X random variable only
takes on non-negative values.

14
00:00:41,670 --> 00:00:45,710
And so the probability that X is
less than or equal to some

15
00:00:45,710 --> 00:00:49,155
negative number is
going to be 0.

16
00:00:49,155 --> 00:00:52,080
On the other hand, if x is
greater than or equal to 0, we

17
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,490
do actually have to
integrate here.

18
00:00:54,490 --> 00:01:00,800
So to do that, we take the
integral from minus infinity

19
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,390
to x of fx(t) --

20
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:06,570
the dummy variable
here used is t.

21
00:01:06,570 --> 00:01:12,080
Notice that again, fx(t) is
going to be 0 for negative

22
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,310
values, so we take the
integral here from 0.

23
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:22,205
And now we plug in for fx(t).

24
00:01:22,205 --> 00:01:25,760
That's minus lambda t dt.

25
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,970
And recall that the integral
of e to the a t is 1 over a

26
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,425
times e to the a t.

27
00:01:34,425 --> 00:01:37,020
So here in this case,
we'll get lambda,

28
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:37,900
which is just a constant.

29
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:40,610
And then a here is going
to be negative lambda.

30
00:01:40,610 --> 00:01:46,060
So we get this, 0 to x.

31
00:01:46,060 --> 00:01:50,520
Lambdas cancel and we actually
get 1 minus e to the

32
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,600
minus lambda x.

33
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:55,310

34
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,760
So do this.

35
00:01:57,760 --> 00:01:59,150
And we are done with the CDF.

36
00:01:59,150 --> 00:02:01,700

37
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,630
Now for the expectation.

38
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:13,520
We use the standard formula,
which is minus infinity to

39
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:20,250
infinity t times fx(t) .

40
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,410
So again, fx(t) is going to
be 0 for a negative value.

41
00:02:24,410 --> 00:02:28,670
So we do the integral from 0.

42
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:37,130
We get 0 to infinity t lambda
e to the minus lambda t dt.

43
00:02:37,130 --> 00:02:41,700
Now, you can try all you want
to get rid of this t.

44
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,850
It's not going to go even if
you try all kinds of u

45
00:02:43,850 --> 00:02:44,740
substitution.

46
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:49,050
But at the end the day, you're
going to have to pull out your

47
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,380
calculus textbook and find
the integration by parts

48
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:55,863
formula, which is--

49
00:02:55,863 --> 00:03:04,340

50
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:05,590
v du.

51
00:03:05,590 --> 00:03:07,630

52
00:03:07,630 --> 00:03:10,370
So the hope is that this
integral is going to be easier

53
00:03:10,370 --> 00:03:12,170
than the one on the left.

54
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:15,603
Notice that this is the
integral of one

55
00:03:15,603 --> 00:03:17,100
of the terms here.

56
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,880
And this is the derivative
of one of the terms.

57
00:03:18,880 --> 00:03:22,780
So that may help you decide
on how you select u and v.

58
00:03:22,780 --> 00:03:27,310
In our case actually, I'm
going to use u as--

59
00:03:27,310 --> 00:03:28,490
t for u.

60
00:03:28,490 --> 00:03:30,860
Because when you take
the derivative, it's

61
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,780
going to become 1.

62
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,175
And the derivative is what's
going to go in that integral.

63
00:03:34,175 --> 00:03:38,100

64
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,290
So this is going to
be dt for du.

65
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:43,140
And then, dv I'm going
to select as

66
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,930
whatever's left over.

67
00:03:43,930 --> 00:03:47,130
It's lambda e to minus
lambda t dt.

68
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:49,070
So v is going to be--

69
00:03:49,070 --> 00:03:50,490
we already did the integral--

70
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,457
minus e to the minus lambda t.

71
00:03:52,457 --> 00:03:55,390

72
00:03:55,390 --> 00:04:01,740
And so if we do this, it's going
to be negative t times e

73
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:03,550
to the minus lambda t.

74
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:04,720
So that's uv.

75
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:08,240
Minus v, which is negative
e to the minus

76
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,430
lambda t times dt.

77
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:13,310
That goes from 0 to infinity.

78
00:04:13,310 --> 00:04:17,529
This is evaluated from
0 to infinity.

79
00:04:17,529 --> 00:04:19,990
Well, what does it mean
for this to be

80
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,300
evaluated from 0 to infinity?

81
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:25,640
A better and easier way to look
at this is to say, well,

82
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,890
it's going to go from 0 to x.

83
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:31,960
But then you take the limit
as x goes to infinity.

84
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:34,540
So that's going to
help us here.

85
00:04:34,540 --> 00:04:35,860
And this negative--

86
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,310
these negatives cancel.

87
00:04:37,310 --> 00:04:39,040
And we're left with--

88
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,280
let's plug in the bounds.

89
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:51,010
We're left with negative x
minus lambda x plus the

90
00:04:51,010 --> 00:04:56,610
integral of this is going to be
1 over negative lambda e to

91
00:04:56,610 --> 00:05:03,050
the minus lambda t evaluated
from 0 to infinity.

92
00:05:03,050 --> 00:05:07,210
All right, so now the limit.

93
00:05:07,210 --> 00:05:11,490
So for the limit, notice
that x increases

94
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:14,140
as x goes to infinity.

95
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:17,650
And this exponential decays.

96
00:05:17,650 --> 00:05:19,890
So they're kind of competing
for each other.

97
00:05:19,890 --> 00:05:22,830
But the exponential is going to
win because it decays way

98
00:05:22,830 --> 00:05:24,160
faster than x.

99
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:27,580
And so this first term
is going to go off--

100
00:05:27,580 --> 00:05:29,490
the limit is going to go to 0.

101
00:05:29,490 --> 00:05:36,930

102
00:05:36,930 --> 00:05:37,820
All right.

103
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:40,582
For this, if you evaluate
the balance, the

104
00:05:40,582 --> 00:05:42,750
infinity makes this 0.

105
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,650
And 0, you're going to
get 1 over lambda.

106
00:05:47,650 --> 00:05:49,520
So that's 1 over lambda.

107
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:50,340
All right.

108
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:55,900
And so the expectation
is 1 over lambda.

109
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,290
OK, so now what's
the variance?

110
00:05:59,290 --> 00:06:01,750
That's part c, right?

111
00:06:01,750 --> 00:06:11,710
So we use the standard formula
for variance, which is this.

112
00:06:11,710 --> 00:06:15,930

113
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:17,640
We already figured out
the expectation.

114
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:21,380
We just need to figure out the
expectation of X squared.

115
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:24,850
Well, we're just going to follow
the same set of steps

116
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:25,710
from before.

117
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:29,360
For X squared, it's just going
to be t squared, t squared, t

118
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,010
squared, x squared.

119
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:36,680
The only thing that's going to
change is what we choose for u

120
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:37,920
here, for the u substitution.

121
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:40,310
So it's going to be t squared.

122
00:06:40,310 --> 00:06:43,530
So the derivative is going
to change to 2t dt.

123
00:06:43,530 --> 00:06:45,880
v is going to be exactly
the same.

124
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:51,160
And so here in this term, we
get negative 2t e to the

125
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:54,410
minus lambda t.

126
00:06:54,410 --> 00:06:56,660
But there's a negative sign
out here, so the negatives

127
00:06:56,660 --> 00:07:01,460
cancel and we're left with
a positive sign here.

128
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:04,120
This is going to change.

129
00:07:04,120 --> 00:07:06,450
All right.

130
00:07:06,450 --> 00:07:07,190
OK.

131
00:07:07,190 --> 00:07:10,840
So in order to do this integral,
we can use a trick.

132
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,830
We can move this--

133
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:14,090
so there's a 2t here.

134
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:17,710
We move this 2 in here,
leave the t inside.

135
00:07:17,710 --> 00:07:20,200
And you have to leave
the t inside.

136
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:24,530
But multiply by lambda
and divide by lambda.

137
00:07:24,530 --> 00:07:27,050

138
00:07:27,050 --> 00:07:28,750
Now, look at that integral.

139
00:07:28,750 --> 00:07:32,870
0 to infinity t times lambda
e to the minus lambda t dt.

140
00:07:32,870 --> 00:07:36,200
Exactly the expectation
that we computed.

141
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:37,622
We already did that.

142
00:07:37,622 --> 00:07:42,260
That is just 1 over lambda, so
it's 2 over lambda times 1

143
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:43,900
over lambda.

144
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:47,350
Again, the limit as x
goes to infinity--

145
00:07:47,350 --> 00:07:51,180
the exponential will
beat x squared.

146
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:53,810
No matter what polynomial
we put in there, the

147
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:56,070
exponential's going to win.

148
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:59,320
So this is going
to be 0 still.

149
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:02,760
This one's going to be 2
over lambda squared.

150
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:06,590
So we're left with 2 over lambda
squared for expectation

151
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:09,700
of X squared.

152
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:17,170
And so we have 1 over lambda
squared for the variance.

153
00:08:17,170 --> 00:08:19,265
OK, so we're done with
the variance.

154
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:23,980

155
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:25,710
Part d.

156
00:08:25,710 --> 00:08:31,580
We're given that X1, X2, and
X3 are independent and

157
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:32,669
identically distributed.

158
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:34,659
They're exponentials
with rate lambda.

159
00:08:34,659 --> 00:08:37,690
We're asked for the PDF
of Z, which is the max

160
00:08:37,690 --> 00:08:39,809
of X1, x2, and x2.

161
00:08:39,809 --> 00:08:42,610
How do we generally
find a PDF?

162
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:47,100
We take the CDF and then take
the derivative, right?

163
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:49,920
We first find the CDF, and
then take the derivative.

164
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:54,110
So let's do that.

165
00:08:54,110 --> 00:08:56,300
So first, let's see.

166
00:08:56,300 --> 00:09:02,540
Part d, find the CDF of Z,
which is going to be the

167
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:06,330
probability that Z is less than
or equal to little z,

168
00:09:06,330 --> 00:09:09,330
which is going to be equal to
the probability that the max

169
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:15,680
of X1, X2, X3 is less
than or equal to z.

170
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:17,910
And this is going to have
the same sort of

171
00:09:17,910 --> 00:09:18,920
structure as before.

172
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:23,800
If z is less than 0, X1,
x2, X3 are positive--

173
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:24,650
non-negative.

174
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:28,380
And so this is the probability
that if you get little z less

175
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,850
than 0, you're not going to have
any probability there.

176
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:36,630
And so if z is greater than or
equal to 0 is where it gets

177
00:09:36,630 --> 00:09:37,680
interesting.

178
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:38,930
We need to do something
special.

179
00:09:38,930 --> 00:09:45,570

180
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,210
So the special thing here
is to recognize that the

181
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,770
probability of the max being
less than or equal to z is

182
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:58,545
actually also the probability
of each of these random

183
00:09:58,545 --> 00:10:02,000
variables individually being
less than or equal to z.

184
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,510
Why is that true?

185
00:10:04,510 --> 00:10:07,200
One way to check whether the
events-- these two events are

186
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:11,170
the same is to check
the two directions.

187
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:14,512
One direction say, if the max of
X1, X2, X3 is less than or

188
00:10:14,512 --> 00:10:18,400
equal to z, does that mean X1 is
less than or equal to z, X2

189
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,730
is less than or equal
to z, and X3 is less

190
00:10:19,730 --> 00:10:21,050
than or equal to z?

191
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:21,640
Yes.

192
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:22,600
OK.

193
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,116
And then, if X1, X2, and X3 are
individually less than or

194
00:10:26,116 --> 00:10:29,870
equal to z, then the max is also
less than or equal to z.

195
00:10:29,870 --> 00:10:35,950
So these two events are
equivalent and this is true.

196
00:10:35,950 --> 00:10:37,800
By independence we can
break this up.

197
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:47,720

198
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,660
And we get--

199
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:53,050
these are all CDFs of the
exponential and they

200
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,500
all have this form.

201
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,030
So it's just going to
be 1 minus e to the

202
00:10:57,030 --> 00:11:02,370
minus lambda z cubed.

203
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:03,620
Plug this in here.

204
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:07,990

205
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:10,550
And then, try to take the
derivative to get the PDF.

206
00:11:10,550 --> 00:11:21,530

207
00:11:21,530 --> 00:11:21,940
Let's see.

208
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:28,250
So it's going to be the same,
like this for z less than 0.

209
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:30,700
For z greater than or equal
to 0, it's going to be the

210
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,700
derivative of this thing.

211
00:11:32,700 --> 00:11:38,080
Derivative of this thing is by
chain rule, 3 times 1 minus e

212
00:11:38,080 --> 00:11:40,980
to the minus lambda z squared.

213
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:43,360
Then the derivative of negative
e to the minus lambda

214
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,040
z, that's just lambda e
to the minus lambda z.

215
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,370
There we go.

216
00:11:51,370 --> 00:11:54,710
This is the PDF we
were looking for.

217
00:11:54,710 --> 00:11:55,850
So last problem.

218
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:58,240
We're looking for the PDF
of W, which is the

219
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:00,770
min of X1 and X2.

220
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:03,830
So let's try this as
a similar approach.

221
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,670
Try the same thing, actually.

222
00:12:05,670 --> 00:12:06,920
See if it works.

223
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:15,260

224
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:23,785
So w, w, w, w, min, less
than or equal to w.

225
00:12:23,785 --> 00:12:26,700

226
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:27,720
OK.

227
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:28,970
So let's see if this works.

228
00:12:28,970 --> 00:12:36,860

229
00:12:36,860 --> 00:12:39,250
Is it true that the min--

230
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:45,360
if the min of X1 and X2 is less
than or equal to w, that

231
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,910
each of them is less
than or equal to w?

232
00:12:47,910 --> 00:12:49,220
No, right?

233
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:52,590
X1 could be less than or
equal to w and X2 could

234
00:12:52,590 --> 00:12:53,690
be bigger than w.

235
00:12:53,690 --> 00:12:57,682
And the min could still be
less than or equal to w.

236
00:12:57,682 --> 00:13:00,560
So that's definitely not true.

237
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,310
So what do we do here?

238
00:13:04,310 --> 00:13:12,430
The trick is to flip it and say
we want to compute the min

239
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:15,850
of X1 and X2 being
greater than w.

240
00:13:15,850 --> 00:13:20,860
In that case, let's check
if we can do this trick.

241
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:26,420

242
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,960
If the min of X1 and X2 is
greater than w, then clearly

243
00:13:30,960 --> 00:13:33,650
X1 is bigger than w and
X2 is bigger than w.

244
00:13:33,650 --> 00:13:36,405
And if X1 and X2 are
individually bigger than w,

245
00:13:36,405 --> 00:13:40,390
then clearly the min's
also bigger than w.

246
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:41,600
So this works.

247
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,390
And now we can use independence
as before.

248
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,610

249
00:13:48,610 --> 00:13:51,860
And for this, this is just
1 minus the CDF here.

250
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,790
So it's just going to be
e to the minus lambda

251
00:13:54,790 --> 00:13:59,950
w for each of them.

252
00:13:59,950 --> 00:14:03,020
But that's the same as e
to the minus lambda 2w.

253
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:09,070

254
00:14:09,070 --> 00:14:12,140
Or e to the 2 lambda w.

255
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,390
So it's going to be--

256
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:18,330

257
00:14:18,330 --> 00:14:21,110
Notice the similarity between
this and this.

258
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:24,350

259
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:28,120
The only difference is this
has a 2 lambda in there.

260
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,210
That means that W is an
exponential random variable

261
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:34,260
with rate 2 lambda.

262
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:42,720
So then the PDF is going to be
an exponential, whatever it is

263
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:45,260
for an exponential.

264
00:14:45,260 --> 00:14:48,280
Except with rate 2 lambda.

265
00:14:48,280 --> 00:14:55,470

266
00:14:55,470 --> 00:14:58,550
You can also take the derivative
of this and find

267
00:14:58,550 --> 00:15:00,950
that you get this.

268
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,182
OK, so we're done with
the problems.

269
00:15:05,182 --> 00:15:08,590
We computed some interesting
quantities for the exponential

270
00:15:08,590 --> 00:15:10,950
random variable in this video.
