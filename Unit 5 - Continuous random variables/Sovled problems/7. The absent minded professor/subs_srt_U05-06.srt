1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,430

2
00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:00,860
Hi.

3
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:03,820
In this problem, we have an
absent-minded professor who

4
00:00:03,820 --> 00:00:06,860
will inadvertently give us some
practice with exponential

5
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:08,460
random variables.

6
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:13,630
So the professor has made two
appointments with two students

7
00:00:13,630 --> 00:00:17,480
and inadvertently made them
at the same time.

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,390
And what we do is we model the
duration of these appointments

9
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,340
with an exponential
random variable.

10
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:26,760
So remember, an exponential
random variable is a

11
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:29,850
continuous random variable that
takes on non-negative

12
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,980
values, and it's parametrized
by a rate parameter, lambda.

13
00:00:35,980 --> 00:00:39,030
And the exponential random
variable is often used to

14
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:42,670
model durations of time-- so
time until something happens,

15
00:00:42,670 --> 00:00:46,310
so for example, in this case,
time until the student leaves

16
00:00:46,310 --> 00:00:47,420
or the appointment is over.

17
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:51,180
Or sometimes you will also use
it to be as a model of time

18
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:52,430
until something fails.

19
00:00:52,430 --> 00:00:54,600

20
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:59,010
And one thing that will be
useful is the CDF of this

21
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:00,240
exponential random variable.

22
00:01:00,240 --> 00:01:02,280
So the probability that it's
less than or equal to some

23
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:07,290
value, little t, is equal to 1
minus e to the minus lambda t.

24
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,970
So this is, of course, valid
only when t is non-negative.

25
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,750
The other useful property is
that the expected value of an

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:17,790
exponential random variable
is just 1 over

27
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,280
the parameter lambda.

28
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,390
And the last thing that we'll
use specifically in this

29
00:01:22,390 --> 00:01:24,450
problem is the memoryless
property of

30
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:25,410
exponential random variables.

31
00:01:25,410 --> 00:01:30,490
And so recall that that just
means that if you pop in the

32
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:36,700
middle of an exponential
random variable, the

33
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,350
distribution for that random
variable going forward from

34
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:43,345
the point where you popped in
is exactly the same as if it

35
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:44,400
had just started over.

36
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:46,430
So that's why we call it the
memoryless property.

37
00:01:46,430 --> 00:01:49,250
Basically, the past doesn't
really matter, and going

38
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:52,670
forward from whatever point
that you observe it at, it

39
00:01:52,670 --> 00:01:58,310
looks as if it had just
started over afresh.

40
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:02,350
And last thing we'll use, which
is a review of a concept

41
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:06,780
from earlier, is total
expectation.

42
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:08,889
So let's actually model
this problem

43
00:02:08,889 --> 00:02:10,979
with two random variables.

44
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:17,080
Let's let T1 be the time that
the first student takes in the

45
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,760
appointment and T2 be the time
that the second student takes.

46
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,160
And what we're told in the
problem is that they're both

47
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,000
exponential with mean
30 minutes.

48
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,240
So remember the mean being 30
minutes means that the lambda

49
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,640
is 1 over the mean.

50
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,260
And so the lambda in this
case would be 1/30.

51
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:35,770
And importantly, we're also
told that they are

52
00:02:35,770 --> 00:02:36,710
independent.

53
00:02:36,710 --> 00:02:40,160
So how long the first person
takes is independent of how

54
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,960
long the second person takes.

55
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:46,560
So the first student arrives on
time and take some random

56
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,110
amount of time, T1.

57
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:51,330
The second student arrives
exactly five minutes late.

58
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:55,170
And whatever the second person
meets with the professor, that

59
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:58,310
student will then take some
random amount of time, T2.

60
00:02:58,310 --> 00:03:01,810
What we're asked to do is find
the expected time between when

61
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:03,270
the first student arrives--

62
00:03:03,270 --> 00:03:05,370
so we can just call
that time 0--

63
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:08,920
and when the second
student leaves.

64
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:12,580
Now you may say, well we're
dealing with expectations, so

65
00:03:12,580 --> 00:03:13,890
it's easier.

66
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:19,640
And in this case, it probably is
just the expectation of how

67
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,540
long the first student takes
plus the expectation of how

68
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:22,540
long the second student takes.

69
00:03:22,540 --> 00:03:26,450
So it should be about 60 minutes
or exactly 60 minutes.

70
00:03:26,450 --> 00:03:28,940
Now, why is that not
exactly right?

71
00:03:28,940 --> 00:03:36,450
It's because there is a small
wrinkle, that the students may

72
00:03:36,450 --> 00:03:38,660
not go exactly back to back.

73
00:03:38,660 --> 00:03:41,970
So let's actually draw out a
time frame of what might

74
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:44,640
actually happen.

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,240
So here's time 0, when the
first student arrives.

76
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:52,270
And the first will go for some
amount of time and leave.

77
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:54,390
And now let's consider
two scenarios.

78
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:00,570
One scenario is that the first
student takes more than five

79
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:01,560
minutes to complete.

80
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:10,120
Well then the second student
will have arrived at 5 minutes

81
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:14,210
and then will be already waiting
whenever this first

82
00:04:14,210 --> 00:04:14,810
student leaves.

83
00:04:14,810 --> 00:04:16,180
So then the second student will

84
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:18,310
immediately pick up and continue.

85
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:22,740
And in that case, we do have two
exponentials back to back.

86
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:25,370
But there could be another
situation.

87
00:04:25,370 --> 00:04:32,110
Suppose that the first student
didn't take very long at all

88
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:37,260
and finished within five
minutes, in which case the

89
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:38,490
second student hasn't
arrived yet.

90
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:42,530
So this professor is idle
in between here.

91
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:45,970
And so we actually don't
necessarily have two of them

92
00:04:45,970 --> 00:04:47,190
going back to back.

93
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:50,260
So there's an empty period in
between that we have to

94
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:52,270
account for.

95
00:04:52,270 --> 00:04:57,730
So with that in mind, we see
that we have two scenarios.

96
00:04:57,730 --> 00:04:59,640
And so what does that
beg to use?

97
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:02,520
Well, we can split them up into
the two scenarios and

98
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:05,140
then calculate expectations
with each one and then use

99
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:09,280
total expectation to
find the overall

100
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,090
expected length of time.

101
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:15,350
OK, so let's begin with
the first scenario.

102
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:19,690

103
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:24,450
The first scenario is that,
let's say, the first student

104
00:05:24,450 --> 00:05:27,710
finished within five minutes.

105
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:30,840
So what does that mean in terms
of the definitions that

106
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:31,870
we've used?

107
00:05:31,870 --> 00:05:37,050
That means T1 is less
than or equal to 5.

108
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:40,460
So if the first student took
less than five minutes, then

109
00:05:40,460 --> 00:05:41,840
what happens?

110
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,070
Then we know that the
amount of time that

111
00:05:46,070 --> 00:05:47,320
you'd need to take--

112
00:05:47,320 --> 00:05:51,510

113
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,600
let's call that something
else.

114
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,190
Let's call that X. So X is the
random variable that we're

115
00:05:58,190 --> 00:06:01,580
interested in, the time between
when the first student

116
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,140
comes and the second
student leaves.

117
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,950
This is the value that
we want to find.

118
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:10,440
Well we know that we're
guaranteed that there will be

119
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:12,720
a five-minute interval.

120
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,260
So first student will come,
and then the second person

121
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,070
will take over.

122
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:31,340
So we're guaranteed that the
first five minutes will be the

123
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,380
difference between when time
starts and when the second

124
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:35,240
student arrives.

125
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,670
And then, after that, it's just
however long the second

126
00:06:39,670 --> 00:06:44,320
student takes, which is just
the expected value of T2.

127
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,770
And T2 is a exponential random
variable with mean 30.

128
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,325
So in this case, it's just 35.

129
00:06:51,325 --> 00:06:55,800

130
00:06:55,800 --> 00:06:58,410
So the first student doesn't
take very long.

131
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:02,320
Then we just get the five
minutes, that little buffer,

132
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,170
plus however long the second
student takes, which, on

133
00:07:04,170 --> 00:07:06,640
average, is 30 minutes.

134
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,260
Now what is the probability
of this happening?

135
00:07:09,260 --> 00:07:12,820
The probability of this
happening is the probability

136
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:16,080
that the first student takes
less than five minutes.

137
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,980
And here is where we use the CDF
that we wrote out earlier.

138
00:07:21,980 --> 00:07:30,650
It's going to be 1 minus e
to the minus lambda t.

139
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:35,550
So in this case, t is five
and lambda is 1/30.

140
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:40,440
So it's minus 5/30 is
the probability.

141
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,580
All right, now let's consider
the second case.

142
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:47,690
The second case is that the
first student actually takes

143
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:50,360
longer than five minutes.

144
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:54,350
OK, so what happens
in that case?

145
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:54,880
Here's five minutes.

146
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:58,300
The first student came
to five minutes.

147
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,665
The second student arrived,
and the first

148
00:08:00,665 --> 00:08:02,640
student is still going.

149
00:08:02,640 --> 00:08:06,320
So he goes for some
amount of time.

150
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:10,310
And then whenever he finishes,
the second student continues.

151
00:08:10,310 --> 00:08:13,120
So now the question is, what
is the total amount of

152
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,960
time in this case?

153
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:22,150
Well, you can think of it as
using the memoryless property.

154
00:08:22,150 --> 00:08:24,020
This is where it comes in.

155
00:08:24,020 --> 00:08:27,550
So the first five minutes, we
know that it was already taken

156
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:31,390
because we're considering the
second scenario, which we're

157
00:08:31,390 --> 00:08:34,860
given that T1 is
greater than 5.

158
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:38,190
And so the question now is, if
we know that, how much longer

159
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:39,650
does it take?

160
00:08:39,650 --> 00:08:41,799
How much longer past the
five-minute mark does the

161
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,049
first student take?

162
00:08:43,049 --> 00:08:46,570
And by the memoryless property,
we know that it's as

163
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:49,210
if the first student
started over.

164
00:08:49,210 --> 00:08:51,800
So there was no memory of the
first five minutes, and it's

165
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:55,310
as if the first student just
arrived also at the

166
00:08:55,310 --> 00:08:57,000
five-minute mark and met
with the professor.

167
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:02,950
So past the five-minute mark,
it's as if you have a new

168
00:09:02,950 --> 00:09:06,300
exponential random variable,
still with mean 30.

169
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,490
And so what we get is that,
in this case, you get the

170
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,760
guaranteed five minutes, and
then you get the memoryless

171
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:25,860
continuation of the first
student's appointment.

172
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:28,460
So you get another 30 minutes
on average because of the

173
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,640
memoryless property.

174
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:32,470
And then whenever the first
student finally does finish

175
00:09:32,470 --> 00:09:35,950
up, the second student will
immediately take over because

176
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:37,080
he has already arrived.

177
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,580
It's past the five-minute
mark.

178
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:41,520
And then that second student
will take, again, on average,

179
00:09:41,520 --> 00:09:42,530
30 more minutes.

180
00:09:42,530 --> 00:09:47,130
So what you get is, in this
case, the appointment lasts 65

181
00:09:47,130 --> 00:09:49,540
minutes on average.

182
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:51,100
Now what is the probability
of this case?

183
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:55,410
The probability of this case is
the probability that T1 is

184
00:09:55,410 --> 00:09:57,150
greater than 5.

185
00:09:57,150 --> 00:10:00,720
And now we know that that is
just the complement of this, 1

186
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:01,520
minus that.

187
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:04,050
So it's just e to
the minus 5/30.

188
00:10:04,050 --> 00:10:06,840

189
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,490
So now we have both scenarios.

190
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:12,850
We have the probabilities of
each scenario, and we have the

191
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:15,980
expectation under
each scenario.

192
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,810
Now all that remains now is to
combine them using total

193
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,060
expectation.

194
00:10:20,060 --> 00:10:26,990

195
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:36,880
So I really should have written
expectation of X given

196
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,920
T1 is less than or
equal to 5 here.

197
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,630
And this is expectation
of X given that T1 is

198
00:10:42,630 --> 00:10:44,840
greater than 5.

199
00:10:44,840 --> 00:10:49,840
So expectation of X overall is
the probability that T1 is

200
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:54,250
less than or equal to 5 times
the expectation of X given

201
00:10:54,250 --> 00:10:59,190
that T1 is less than or equal to
5 plus the probability that

202
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:04,790
T1 is greater than 5 times the
expectation of X given that T1

203
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:07,640
is greater than 5.

204
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:10,440
And we have all four of
these pieces here.

205
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:23,220
so it's 35 times 1 minus e to
the minus 5/30 plus 65 times e

206
00:11:23,220 --> 00:11:26,650
to the minus 5 5/30.

207
00:11:26,650 --> 00:11:31,600
And it turns out that this
is approximately

208
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:39,790
equal to 60.394 minutes.

209
00:11:39,790 --> 00:11:42,610
All right, so what
have we found?

210
00:11:42,610 --> 00:11:47,430
We found that the original guess
that we had, if we just

211
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:50,360
had two meetings back to back,
was on average it would take

212
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:51,310
60 minutes.

213
00:11:51,310 --> 00:11:55,150
It turns out that, because of
the way that things are set

214
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:58,890
up, because of the five minute
thing, it actually takes a

215
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,780
little longer than 60
minutes on average.

216
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,700
And why is that?

217
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:08,630
It's because the five sometimes
adds an extra

218
00:12:08,630 --> 00:12:13,930
buffer, adds a little bit of
extra amount, because it would

219
00:12:13,930 --> 00:12:18,820
have been shorter in this
scenario because, if the both

220
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,030
students had arrived on time,
then the second student would

221
00:12:21,030 --> 00:12:23,570
have been able to pick up
right here immediately.

222
00:12:23,570 --> 00:12:26,180
And so both appointments would
have ended sooner.

223
00:12:26,180 --> 00:12:29,880
But because the second student
didn't arrive until five

224
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:32,490
minutes, there was some empty
space that was wasted.

225
00:12:32,490 --> 00:12:36,140
And that's where you get you the
little bit of extra time.

226
00:12:36,140 --> 00:12:39,760
So this is a nice problem just
to get some more exercise with

227
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,590
exponential random variables
and also nicely illustrates

228
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:46,850
the memoryless property, which
was a key points in order to

229
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,680
solve this.

230
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,170
And it also is nice because we
get to review a useful tool

231
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:56,350
that we've been using all course
long, which is to split

232
00:12:56,350 --> 00:13:00,010
things into different scenarios
and then solve the

233
00:13:00,010 --> 00:13:02,770
simpler problems and then
combine them up, for example

234
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:05,490
using total expectation.

235
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:08,120
So I hope that was helpful,
and see you next time.

236
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,334
