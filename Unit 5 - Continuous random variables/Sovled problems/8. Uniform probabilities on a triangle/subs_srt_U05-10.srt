00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,240

2
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:01,220
Hi.

3
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:03,180
In this problem, we're going
to get a bunch of practice

4
00:00:03,180 --> 00:00:05,560
working with multiple random
variables together.

5
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,050
And so we'll look at joint
PDFs, marginal PDFs,

6
00:00:09,050 --> 00:00:11,850
conditional PDFs, and also get
some practice calculating

7
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:14,380
expectations as well.

8
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:20,660
So the problem gives us a pair
of random variables, X and Y.

9
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:25,190
And we're told that the joint
distribution is uniformly

10
00:00:25,190 --> 00:00:30,875
distributed on this triangle
here, with vertices being 0,

11
00:00:30,875 --> 00:00:34,030
0; 1, 0; and 0, 1.

12
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,030
So it's uniform in
this triangle.

13
00:00:37,030 --> 00:00:39,490
And the first part of the
problem is just to figure out

14
00:00:39,490 --> 00:00:45,030
what exactly is this joint PDF
of the two random variables.

15
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:48,570
So in this case, it's pretty
easy to calculate, because we

16
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:50,160
have a uniform distribution.

17
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,560
And remember, when you have a
uniform distribution, you can

18
00:00:52,560 --> 00:00:55,390
just imagine it being
a sort of plateau

19
00:00:55,390 --> 00:00:56,570
coming out of the board.

20
00:00:56,570 --> 00:00:57,650
And it's flat.

21
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:01,490
And so the height of the
plateau, really, in order to

22
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:04,489
calculate it, you just need to
figure out what the area of

23
00:01:04,489 --> 00:01:06,480
this thing is, of this
triangle is.

24
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,860
So remember, when you had single
random variables, what

25
00:01:08,860 --> 00:01:13,230
we had to do was calculate, for
our uniform distribution,

26
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,760
had to integrate to 1.

27
00:01:14,760 --> 00:01:17,710
So you took the length, and you
took 1 over the length was

28
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:19,610
the scaling factor.

29
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:24,300
Here, you take the area.

30
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,450
And the height has to make it so
that the entire volume here

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,360
integrates to 1.

32
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:33,660
So the joint PDF is just
going to be 1 over

33
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,830
whatever this area is.

34
00:01:34,830 --> 00:01:36,390
And the area is pretty
simple to calculate.

35
00:01:36,390 --> 00:01:38,330
It's 1/2 base times height.

36
00:01:38,330 --> 00:01:40,240
So it's 1/2.

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,460
And so what we have is that the
area is 1/2, and so the

38
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:51,950
joint PDF of x and y is
going to equal 2.

39
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:56,170
But remember, you always have
to be careful when writing

40
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:58,710
these things to remember
the ranges when

41
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,880
these things are valid.

42
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,540
So it's only two within
this triangle.

43
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,570
And outside of the
triangle, it's 0.

44
00:02:05,570 --> 00:02:08,930
So what exactly does inside
the triangle mean?

45
00:02:08,930 --> 00:02:12,460
Well, we can write it
more mathematically.

46
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:19,830
So this diagonal line, it's
given by x plus y equals 1.

47
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:23,740
So everything in the triangle
is really x plus y is less

48
00:02:23,740 --> 00:02:24,330
than or equal to 1.

49
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,530
It means everything under
this triangle.

50
00:02:26,530 --> 00:02:30,510
And so we need x plus y to be
less than or equal to 1, and

51
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:33,175
also x to be non-negative and
y to be non-negative.

52
00:02:33,175 --> 00:02:36,350

53
00:02:36,350 --> 00:02:39,680
So with these inequalities,
that captures everything

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:40,870
within this triangle.

55
00:02:40,870 --> 00:02:46,870
And otherwise, the joint
PDF is going to be 0.

56
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:49,710

57
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:54,130
The next part asks us to find,
using this joint PDF, the

58
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:57,890
marginal PDF of Y. And remember,
when you have a

59
00:02:57,890 --> 00:03:00,390
joint PDF of two random
variables, you essentially

60
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,560
have everything that you need,
because from this joint PDF,

61
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,870
you can calculate marginals,
you can calculate from

62
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:06,500
marginals, you can calculate
conditionals.

63
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:09,670
And essentially, the joint PDF
captures everything that there

64
00:03:09,670 --> 00:03:13,830
is to know about this pair
of random variables.

65
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:17,470
Now, to calculate a marginal PDF
of Y, remember a marginal

66
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:20,730
really just means collapsing
the other

67
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:22,140
random variable down.

68
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,640
And so you can just imagine
taking this thing and

69
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,310
collapsing it down
onto the y-axis.

70
00:03:28,310 --> 00:03:33,750
And mathematically, that is just
saying that we integrate

71
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,560
out the other random variable.

72
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,100

73
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,950
So the other random variable
in this case will be X. We

74
00:03:43,950 --> 00:03:47,100
take x and we get rid of it by
integrating out from negative

75
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,490
infinity to infinity.

76
00:03:49,490 --> 00:04:00,980
Of course, this joint PDF
is 0 in a lot of places.

77
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:04,090
And so a lot of these
will be 0.

78
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:07,560
And only for a certain range
of x's will this integral

79
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:10,180
actually be non-zero.

80
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:13,590
And so again, the other time
when we have to be careful is

81
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:16,350
when we have the limits of
integration, we need to make

82
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,570
sure that we have the
right limits.

83
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,000
And so we know that the
joint PDF is 2.

84
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,860
It's nonzero only within
this triangle.

85
00:04:24,860 --> 00:04:33,660
And so it's only 2 within
this triangle, which

86
00:04:33,660 --> 00:04:35,990
means what for x?

87
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,970
Well, depending on what
x and y are, this will

88
00:04:38,970 --> 00:04:41,240
be either 2 or 0.

89
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,210
So let's just fix
some value of y.

90
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,400
Pretend that we've picked some
value of y, let's say here.

91
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:51,980
We want this value of y.

92
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,510
Well what are the values of x
such that the joint PDF for

93
00:04:56,510 --> 00:04:59,900
that value of y is
actually nonzero?

94
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:00,800
It's actually 2.

95
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,160
Well, it's everything from
x equals 0 to whatever

96
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,370
x value this is.

97
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:09,530
But this x value, actually, if
you think about it, is just 1

98
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:13,690
minus y, because this line
is x plus y equals 1.

99
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:17,750
So whatever y is, x is going
to be 1 minus that.

100
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:20,860
And so the correct limits
should actually be from

101
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,890
0 to 1 minus y.

102
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:25,970

103
00:05:25,970 --> 00:05:28,740
And then the rest of that
is pretty simple.

104
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,690
You integrate this.

105
00:05:29,690 --> 00:05:31,500
This is a pretty simple
integral.

106
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,730
And you get that it's actually
2 times 1 minus y.

107
00:05:35,730 --> 00:05:36,980
That's a y.

108
00:05:36,980 --> 00:05:40,780

109
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:46,190
But, of course, again, we need
to make sure that we have the

110
00:05:46,190 --> 00:05:48,110
right regions.

111
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:51,440
So this is not always true
for y, of course.

112
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,230
This is only true for
y between 0 and 1.

113
00:05:58,230 --> 00:06:04,550
And otherwise, it's actually 0,
because when you take a y

114
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:09,285
down here, well, no values
of x will give you a

115
00:06:09,285 --> 00:06:10,400
nonzero joint PDF.

116
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:12,860
And if you take a value of y
higher than this, the same

117
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:14,110
thing happens.

118
00:06:14,110 --> 00:06:16,550

119
00:06:16,550 --> 00:06:18,750
So we can actually draw
this out and see

120
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,570
what it looks like.

121
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:25,330
So let's actually draw
a small picture here.

122
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,280
Here's y.

123
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:32,380
Here's the marginal PDF
of Y. And here's 2.

124
00:06:32,380 --> 00:06:33,993
And it actually looks
like this.

125
00:06:33,993 --> 00:06:40,620
It's a triangle and a 0
outside this range.

126
00:06:40,620 --> 00:06:41,940
So does that make sense?

127
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:50,090
Well, first of all, you see that
it actually integrates to

128
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:51,590
1, which is good.

129
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:57,830
And the other thing we notice
is that there is a higher

130
00:06:57,830 --> 00:06:59,860
density for smaller
values of y.

131
00:06:59,860 --> 00:07:00,800
So why is that?

132
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,350
Why are smaller values
of y more likely than

133
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:04,570
larger values of y?

134
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,680
Well, because when you have
smaller values of

135
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,610
y, you're down here.

136
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:14,255
And it's more likely, because
there are more values of x

137
00:07:14,255 --> 00:07:18,080
that go along with it that
make that value y

138
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,210
more likely to appear.

139
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:21,480
Say you have a large
value of y.

140
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,750
Then you're up here
at the tip.

141
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:25,520
Well, there aren't very many
combinations of x of y that

142
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,860
give you that larger
value of y.

143
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:31,550
And so that large value of
y becomes less likely.

144
00:07:31,550 --> 00:07:33,260
Another way to think about it
is, when you collapse this

145
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:38,290
down, there's a lot more stuff
to collapse down at the base.

146
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:40,410
There's a lot of x's
to collapse down.

147
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:44,025
But up here, there's only a
very little bit of x to

148
00:07:44,025 --> 00:07:44,400
collapse down.

149
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,460
And so the PDF of Y becomes more
skewed towards smaller

150
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:50,710
values of y.

151
00:07:50,710 --> 00:07:55,300

152
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:59,410
So now, the next thing that we
want to do is calculate the

153
00:07:59,410 --> 00:08:02,800
conditional PDF of X, given y.

154
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:07,340
Well, let's just recall
what that means.

155
00:08:07,340 --> 00:08:09,330
This is what we're looking for--
the conditional PDF of

156
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,340
X, given Y.

157
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:17,230
And remember, this is calculated
by taking the joint

158
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:24,290
and dividing by the marginal of
Y. So we actually have the

159
00:08:24,290 --> 00:08:25,310
top and the bottom.

160
00:08:25,310 --> 00:08:27,630
We have the joint PDF
from part (a).

161
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:30,170
And from part (b), we calculated
the marginal PDF of

162
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:30,490
Y.

163
00:08:30,490 --> 00:08:33,169
So we have both pieces.

164
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:35,580
So let's actually
plug them in.

165
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:38,080

166
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,299
Again, the thing that you have
to be careful here is about

167
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:46,260
the ranges of x and y where
these things are valid,

168
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,620
because this is only non-zero
when x and y

169
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,260
fall within this triangle.

170
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:56,080
And this is only non-zero when
y is between 0 and 1.

171
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:59,360
And so we need to be careful.

172
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:02,992
So the top, when it's
nonzero, it's 2.

173
00:09:02,992 --> 00:09:06,570
And the bottom, when it's
non-zero, it's 2

174
00:09:06,570 --> 00:09:08,630
times 1 minus y.

175
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:14,120
So you can simplify that
to be 1 over 1 minus y.

176
00:09:14,120 --> 00:09:16,100
And when is this true?

177
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,090
Well, it's true when x and y are
in the triangle and y is

178
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:25,890
between 0 and 1.

179
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:30,250
So put another way, that means
that this is valid when y is

180
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:32,090
between 0 and 1.

181
00:09:32,090 --> 00:09:52,902
And x is between 0 and 1 minus
y, because whatever x has to

182
00:09:52,902 --> 00:09:55,180
be, it has to be such that
they actually still fall

183
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:57,710
within this triangle.

184
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:03,000
And outside of this, it's 0.

185
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:06,540

186
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:09,830
So let's see what this
actually looks like.

187
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:14,550

188
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:24,010
So this is x, and this is
conditional PDF of X given Y.

189
00:10:24,010 --> 00:10:27,310
Let's say this is
1 right here.

190
00:10:27,310 --> 00:10:32,950
Then this is 1 here.

191
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:37,330
Then what it's saying is,
we're given that y

192
00:10:37,330 --> 00:10:38,130
is some little y.

193
00:10:38,130 --> 00:10:41,660
Let's say it's somewhere here.

194
00:10:41,660 --> 00:10:45,900
Then it's saying that the
conditional PDF of X given Y

195
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,180
is this thing.

196
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,640
But notice that this value,
1 over 1 minus y, does not

197
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:51,880
depend on x.

198
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,940
So in fact, it actually
is uniform.

199
00:10:55,940 --> 00:11:03,200
So it is uniform between
0 and 1 minus y.

200
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:11,400
And the height is something
like 1 over 1 minus y.

201
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,620
And this is so that it's scaling
makes it so that it

202
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:22,950
actually is a valid PDF, because
the integral is to 1.

203
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,840
So why is this the case?

204
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:26,950
Why is it that when you
condition on y being some

205
00:11:26,950 --> 00:11:32,540
value, you get that the PDF
of X is actually uniform?

206
00:11:32,540 --> 00:11:35,210
Well, when you look over here,
let's again pretend that

207
00:11:35,210 --> 00:11:36,930
you're taking this value of y.

208
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:41,140
Well, when you're conditioning
on Y being this value, you're

209
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:45,490
basically taking a slice of this
joint PDF at this point.

210
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:49,200
But remember, the original
joint PDF was uniform.

211
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,680
So when you take a slice of a
uniform distribution, joint

212
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:53,920
uniform distribution,
you still get

213
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:55,330
something that is uniform.

214
00:11:55,330 --> 00:11:59,140
Just imagine that you have,
like, a cake that is flat.

215
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:01,930
Now, you take a slice
at this level.

216
00:12:01,930 --> 00:12:05,660
Then whatever slice you have
is also going to be imagine

217
00:12:05,660 --> 00:12:08,160
being a flat rectangle.

218
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,370
So it's still going
to be uniform.

219
00:12:10,370 --> 00:12:13,690
And that's why the conditional
PDF of X

220
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,960
given Y is also uniform.

221
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:19,350

222
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:25,610
Part (d) now asks us to find a
conditional expectation of X.

223
00:12:25,610 --> 00:12:29,840
So we want to find the
expectation of X given that Y

224
00:12:29,840 --> 00:12:33,170
is some little y.

225
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:37,460
And for this, we can
use the definition.

226
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:40,840
Remember, expectations are
really just weighted sums.

227
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:44,160
In the continuous case,
it's an integral.

228
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,250
So you take the value.

229
00:12:48,250 --> 00:12:51,550
And then you weight
it by the density.

230
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:54,250
And in this case, because
we're taking conditional

231
00:12:54,250 --> 00:12:59,100
expectation, what we weight it
by is the conditional density.

232
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,290
So it's the conditional
density of X given

233
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:04,780
that Y is little y.

234
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:06,320
We integrate with
respect to x.

235
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,650

236
00:13:09,650 --> 00:13:12,280
And fortunately, we know what
this conditional PDF is,

237
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,800
because we calculated it
earlier in part (c).

238
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,370
And we know that it's this--

239
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:20,090
1 over 1 minus y.

240
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:25,780
But again, we have to be
careful, because this formula,

241
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:29,430
1 over 1 minus y, is only
valid for certain cases.

242
00:13:29,430 --> 00:13:31,070
So let's think about
this first.

243
00:13:31,070 --> 00:13:32,480
Let's think about some
extreme cases.

244
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,300
What if little y is negative?

245
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,570
If little y is negative,
we're conditioning on

246
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:41,330
something over here.

247
00:13:41,330 --> 00:13:48,470
And so there is no density for
y being negative or for y,

248
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:51,490
say, in other cases when
y is greater than 1.

249
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:54,630
And so in those cases, this
expectation is just undefined,

250
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:57,630
because conditioning on that
doesn't really make sense,

251
00:13:57,630 --> 00:14:02,760
because there's no density
for those values of y.

252
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:06,410
Now, let's consider the case
that actually makes sense,

253
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:08,970
where y is between 0 and 1.

254
00:14:08,970 --> 00:14:12,350
Now, we're in business, because
that is the range

255
00:14:12,350 --> 00:14:14,860
where this formula is valid.

256
00:14:14,860 --> 00:14:17,710
So this formula is valid,
and we can plug it in.

257
00:14:17,710 --> 00:14:21,610
So it's 1 over 1 minus y dx.

258
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,050
And then the final thing that
we, again, need to check is

259
00:14:24,050 --> 00:14:27,220
what the limits of those
integration is.

260
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:29,460
So we're integrating
with respect to x.

261
00:14:29,460 --> 00:14:33,690
So we need to write down what
values of x, what ranges of x

262
00:14:33,690 --> 00:14:36,410
is this conditional PDF valid?

263
00:14:36,410 --> 00:14:38,920
Well, luckily we specified
that here.

264
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:42,914
x has to be between
0 and 1 minus y.

265
00:14:42,914 --> 00:14:46,040

266
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,160
So let's actually calculate
this integral.

267
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:56,080
This 1 over 1 minus y is a
constant with respect to x.

268
00:14:56,080 --> 00:14:57,940
You can just pull that out.

269
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:00,980
And now, you're really just
integrating x from

270
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:02,810
0 to 1 minus y.

271
00:15:02,810 --> 00:15:06,380
So the integral of x is
1, 1/2 x squared.

272
00:15:06,380 --> 00:15:11,110
So you get a 1/2 x squared, and
you integrate that from 0

273
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:12,430
to 1 minus y.

274
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:14,450
And so when you plug in
the limits, you'll

275
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:18,040
get a 1 minus y squared.

276
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,400
That'll cancel out the
1 over 1 minus y.

277
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:24,480
And what you're left with is
just 1 minus y over 2.

278
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:28,440

279
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:31,630
And again, we have to specify
that this is only true for y

280
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:34,500
between 0 and 1.

281
00:15:34,500 --> 00:15:39,580
Now, we can again actually
verify that this makes sense.

282
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:42,290
What we're really looking for is
the conditional expectation

283
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,720
of X given some value of y.

284
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:47,600
And we already said that
conditioned on Y being some

285
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:50,640
value, X is uniformly
distributed between

286
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,550
0 and 1 minus y.

287
00:15:52,550 --> 00:15:55,040
And so remember, for our uniform
distribution, the

288
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:56,090
expectation is simple.

289
00:15:56,090 --> 00:15:57,160
It's just the midpoint.

290
00:15:57,160 --> 00:16:00,400
So the midpoint of 0
and 1 minus y is

291
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:02,200
exactly 1 minus y/2.

292
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:05,190
So that's a nice way of
verifying that this answer is

293
00:16:05,190 --> 00:16:06,440
actually correct.

294
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,300

295
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:15,590
Now, the second part of
part (d) asks us to do

296
00:16:15,590 --> 00:16:16,840
a little bit more.

297
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:19,910

298
00:16:19,910 --> 00:16:25,850
We have to use the total
expectation theorem in order

299
00:16:25,850 --> 00:16:29,360
to somehow write the expectation
of X in terms of

300
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:36,100
the expectation of Y. So the
first thing we'll do is use

301
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:37,730
the total expectation theorem.

302
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:41,480
So the total expectation theorem
is just saying, well,

303
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:49,560
we can take these conditional
expectations, and now, we can

304
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:55,200
integrate this by the marginal
density of Y, then we'll get

305
00:16:55,200 --> 00:16:57,930
the actual expectation of X.

306
00:16:57,930 --> 00:17:01,870
You could think of it as just
kind of applying a law of

307
00:17:01,870 --> 00:17:03,120
iterated expectations as well.

308
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:06,339

309
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:12,839
So this integral is going
to look like this.

310
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,170
You take the conditional
expectation.

311
00:17:17,170 --> 00:17:22,410
So this is the expectation of X
if Y were equal to little y.

312
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:26,109
And now, what is that
probability?

313
00:17:26,109 --> 00:17:30,220
Well, now, we just multiply that
by the density of Y at

314
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:32,680
that actual value of little y.

315
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,170
And we integrate with
respect to y.

316
00:17:34,170 --> 00:17:37,320

317
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,390
Now, we've already calculated
what this conditional

318
00:17:39,390 --> 00:17:40,560
expectation is.

319
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:44,792
It's 1 minus y/2, so
let's plug that in.

320
00:17:44,792 --> 00:17:55,910
1 minus y/2 times the marginal
of Y. Now, there's a couple

321
00:17:55,910 --> 00:17:57,860
ways of attacking this
problem now.

322
00:17:57,860 --> 00:18:00,160
One way is, we can actually
just plug in

323
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,030
the marginal of y.

324
00:18:01,030 --> 00:18:06,030
We've already calculated
that out in part (b).

325
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,160
And then we can do this integral
and calculate out the

326
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,420
expectation.

327
00:18:09,420 --> 00:18:13,320
But maybe we don't really want
to do so much calculus, so

328
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:16,550
let's do what the problem says
and try a different approach.

329
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:20,720
So what the problem suggests is
to write this in terms of

330
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:23,815
the expectation of Y. And what
is the expectation of Y?

331
00:18:23,815 --> 00:18:28,190
Well, the expectation of Y is
going to look something like

332
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:32,860
the integral of y times
the marginal of Y.

333
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:35,070
So let's see if we can identify
something like that

334
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:36,350
and pull it out.

335
00:18:36,350 --> 00:18:38,480
Well, yeah, we actually
do have that.

336
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,900
We have y times the marginal
of Y, integrated.

337
00:18:41,900 --> 00:18:44,550
So let's isolate that.

338
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:48,510
So besides that, we
also have this.

339
00:18:48,510 --> 00:18:57,780
We have the integral of the
first term, is 1/2 times the

340
00:18:57,780 --> 00:18:59,170
marginal of Y.

341
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:04,170
And then the second term is
minus 1/2 times the integral

342
00:19:04,170 --> 00:19:10,430
of y of fy dy.

343
00:19:10,430 --> 00:19:12,850
This is just me splitting
this integral up into

344
00:19:12,850 --> 00:19:15,930
two separate integrals.

345
00:19:15,930 --> 00:19:17,540
Now, we know what this is.

346
00:19:17,540 --> 00:19:18,800
The 1/2 we can pull out.

347
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:21,720
And then the rest of it is
just the integral of the

348
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:24,390
marginal of a density from minus
infinity to infinity.

349
00:19:24,390 --> 00:19:27,600
And by definition, that
has to be equal to 1.

350
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:32,100
So this just gives us a 1/2.

351
00:19:32,100 --> 00:19:33,660
And now, what is this?

352
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:34,980
We get a minus 1/2.

353
00:19:34,980 --> 00:19:38,360
And now this, we've already said
that is the expectation

354
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:45,550
of Y. So what we have is the
expectation of Y. So in the

355
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:49,350
second part of this part (d),
we've expressed the

356
00:19:49,350 --> 00:19:53,700
expectation of X in terms of
the expectation of Y. Now,

357
00:19:53,700 --> 00:19:57,380
maybe that seems like that's
not too helpful, because we

358
00:19:57,380 --> 00:19:59,740
don't know what either
of those two are.

359
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:04,020
But if we think about this
problem and as part (e)

360
00:20:04,020 --> 00:20:07,040
suggests, we can see that
there's symmetry in this

361
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:12,270
problem, because X and Y are
essentially symmetric.

362
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:17,470
So imagine this is X equals Y.
There's symmetry in this

363
00:20:17,470 --> 00:20:23,290
problem, because if you were to
swap the roles of X and Y,

364
00:20:23,290 --> 00:20:26,350
you would have exactly
the same joint PDF.

365
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:31,510
So what that suggests is that
by symmetry then, it must be

366
00:20:31,510 --> 00:20:35,910
that the expectation of X and
the expectation of Y are

367
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,080
exactly the same.

368
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,030
And that is using the
symmetry argument.

369
00:20:41,030 --> 00:20:45,700
And that helps us now, because
we can plug that in and solve

370
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:50,860
for expectation of X. So
expectation of X is 1/2 minus

371
00:20:50,860 --> 00:20:54,180
1/2 expectation of X.

372
00:20:54,180 --> 00:21:00,710
So we have 3/2 expectation
of X equals 1/2.

373
00:21:00,710 --> 00:21:05,660
So expectation of
X equals 1/3.

374
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:09,600
And of course, expectation
of X is also 1/3.

375
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:14,810
And so it turns out that the
expectation is around there.

376
00:21:14,810 --> 00:21:17,610

377
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:21,070
So this problem had
several parts.

378
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:25,970
And it allowed us to start
out from just a raw joint

379
00:21:25,970 --> 00:21:28,690
distribution, calculate
marginals, correctly

380
00:21:28,690 --> 00:21:31,490
conditionals, and then from
there, calculate all kinds of

381
00:21:31,490 --> 00:21:35,940
conditional expectations
and expectations.

382
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:39,210
A couple of important points to
remember are, when you do

383
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:43,220
these joint distributions,
it's very important to

384
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:47,190
consider where values
are valid.

385
00:21:47,190 --> 00:21:50,190
So you have to keep in mind
when you write out these

386
00:21:50,190 --> 00:21:55,470
conditional PDFs and joint PDFs
and marginal PDFs, what

387
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:59,440
ranges the formulas you
calculated are valid for.

388
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:02,720
And that also translates to
when you're calculating

389
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:03,780
expectations and such.

390
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:06,890
When you have integrals, you
need to be very careful about

391
00:22:06,890 --> 00:22:09,310
limits of your integration, to
make sure that they line up

392
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:12,160
with the values or the range
where the values

393
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,710
are actually valid.

394
00:22:13,710 --> 00:22:17,030
And the last thing, which is
kind of unrelated, but it is

395
00:22:17,030 --> 00:22:20,740
actually a common tool that's
used in a lot of problems is,

396
00:22:20,740 --> 00:22:25,010
when you see symmetry in these
problems, that can help a lot,

397
00:22:25,010 --> 00:22:28,430
because it will simplify things
and allow you to use

398
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:31,180
facts like these to help
you calculate what the

399
00:22:31,180 --> 00:22:32,030
final answer is.

400
00:22:32,030 --> 00:22:35,070
Of course, this also comes
along with practice.

401
00:22:35,070 --> 00:22:37,470
You may not immediately see that
there could be symmetry

402
00:22:37,470 --> 00:22:39,470
argument that will help with
this problem, but with

403
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,530
practice, when you do more
of these problems, you'll

404
00:22:42,530 --> 00:22:45,660
eventually build up
that kind of an

405
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:48,070
appreciation for the symmetry.

406
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:50,530
So I hope that was helpful,
and see you next time.

407
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,780
