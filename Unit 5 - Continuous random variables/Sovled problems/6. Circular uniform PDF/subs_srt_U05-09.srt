00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,910
Hi.

2
00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:05,190
In this problem, we're throwing
a dart at a circle.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,420
And the circle has
radius of r.

4
00:00:08,420 --> 00:00:12,540
And what we assume is that
we always hit the target.

5
00:00:12,540 --> 00:00:16,420
So whatever we throw, the dart
always lands somewhere within

6
00:00:16,420 --> 00:00:17,205
the circle.

7
00:00:17,205 --> 00:00:20,970
And so we don't miss completely
and hit out here.

8
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:26,120
And the other thing we assume is
that all points within the

9
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:28,900
circle are equally likely.

10
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:29,920
All right.

11
00:00:29,920 --> 00:00:31,770
So that's the set
up the problem.

12
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:35,110
And what we're asked to do
is to come up with some

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,780
distributions, some densities.

14
00:00:37,780 --> 00:00:39,700
And the first thing that
we'll do is we'll

15
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:41,240
define two random variables.

16
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,040
All right.

17
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:47,030
So we'll define random
variable X to be the

18
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:55,230
x-coordinate of where we hit
on the target and random

19
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:56,700
variable Y to be the
y-coordinate.

20
00:00:56,700 --> 00:01:01,230

21
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,960
So now we have these two
random variables.

22
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,130
And the first part of the
problem is to calculate what

23
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:08,370
the joint PDF is.

24
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:13,500
So what is the joint
PDF of X and Y?

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:17,150
Well, in this case, it's not so
bad, because we are told to

26
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:19,860
assume that all points
are equally likely.

27
00:01:19,860 --> 00:01:20,960
So what does that mean?

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,170
That means that within this
circle, which is where the

29
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,870
target is, it's uniformly
distributed.

30
00:01:26,870 --> 00:01:29,880
So all points are
equally likely.

31
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:33,360
So all we have to do now to find
what this joint PDF is is

32
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,500
to calculate what this area is
and take 1 over the area.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,000
So it's 1 over the area.

34
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:46,630
And as you know, the area of
the circle is pi r squared.

35
00:01:46,630 --> 00:01:50,740
So it's just 1 over pi r squared
when you are within

36
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,540
the circle.

37
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:53,710
And what is the equation
of a circle?

38
00:01:53,710 --> 00:01:56,420
The equation of a circle
is x squared plus y

39
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,790
squared equals r squared.

40
00:01:57,790 --> 00:02:01,170
So we're centering the
coordinate system at 0.00.

41
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:04,470
That's where the circle
is centered.

42
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:12,120
So we lie within this circle
when x squared plus y squared

43
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:15,660
is less than or equal
to r squared.

44
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:17,970
And we always hit the target.

45
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,460
So we never fall outside
of this circle.

46
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,550
So within the circle, it's
uniformly distributed and the

47
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:32,040
normalization or the scaling
factor is 1 over the area.

48
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,830
And outside, it's 0.

49
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:34,670
All right.

50
00:02:34,670 --> 00:02:37,360
Now, the second part asks us
to find the conditional

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,590
distribution of X given
Y So what is the

52
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:47,830
distribution of X given Y?

53
00:02:47,830 --> 00:02:51,340
Well, the distribution
of X given Y--

54
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:55,820
we know we can calculate that
from taking the joint PDF of X

55
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,650
and Y and dividing by the

56
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:03,210
marginal of Y. OK.

57
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:06,480
So first, let's calculate what
the marginal of y is.

58
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,730
The marginal of y--

59
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,890

60
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:14,570
when you calculate a marginal,
remember, it's just a matter

61
00:03:14,570 --> 00:03:20,190
of taking the joint and
integrating out to the

62
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:21,720
variable that you don't
want any more.

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:25,010
So in this case, we're
integrating out x.

64
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:28,000
And in general, you integrate
from x equals minus infinity

65
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,410
to infinity.

66
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,590
But in this case, we need to be
careful what the limits are

67
00:03:32,590 --> 00:03:37,790
and only integrate when
the limits are valid.

68
00:03:37,790 --> 00:03:40,990
So for now, let's just write
minus infinity to infinity.

69
00:03:40,990 --> 00:03:42,660
And we'll fill that in.

70
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:46,910
So we know that the joint PDF
is just 1 over the area, 1

71
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:48,160
over pi r squared.

72
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:52,050

73
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:56,486
Now, when is this joint
PDF actually valid?

74
00:03:56,486 --> 00:03:57,150
All right.

75
00:03:57,150 --> 00:04:00,230
So now let's fix some value
of y that we want.

76
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:03,010
Let's say it's this
one right here.

77
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:06,210
This is the value of y.

78
00:04:06,210 --> 00:04:11,160
Well, given that that's the
value of y, what range of x is

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:12,584
this joint PDF valid?

80
00:04:12,584 --> 00:04:17,060
Well, it's valid for the range
of x that falls within this

81
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:21,279
band here, from here to here.

82
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:23,350
Now, what are these
two values?

83
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:27,150
Well, if y is here and the
radius is r and we know that

84
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:29,770
the equation of the circle is
x squared plus y squared

85
00:04:29,770 --> 00:04:35,060
equals r squared, then we know
that this point has to equal

86
00:04:35,060 --> 00:04:39,270
the square root of r squared
minus y squared.

87
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,000
That's the value of x that
corresponds with

88
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,970
that value of y.

89
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:50,090
And then similarly, here we have
minus square root of r

90
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:56,700
squared minus y squared.

91
00:04:56,700 --> 00:05:00,570
So that's the range of Xs
for that value of y.

92
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:04,675
So that actually becomes the
limits of our integration.

93
00:05:04,675 --> 00:05:11,720

94
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:14,840
And the good thing
is that this is

95
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:15,910
just a constant, right?

96
00:05:15,910 --> 00:05:18,960
There's no y in here.

97
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,830
And so we can just
pull that out.

98
00:05:20,830 --> 00:05:26,160
And really, it just becomes an
integral of a constant or an

99
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:28,840
integral 1 from minus square
root of r squared minus y

100
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,460
squared 2 square root of r
squared minus y squared.

101
00:05:31,460 --> 00:05:38,010
So it actually is just going
to be 2 square root of r

102
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:45,830
squared minus y squared
over pi r squared.

103
00:05:45,830 --> 00:05:54,590
And again, this is valid only
for y from minus r to r.

104
00:05:54,590 --> 00:05:57,880
And it's 0 otherwise.

105
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:01,210

106
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:02,010
So why is that?

107
00:06:02,010 --> 00:06:07,540
It's because no matter what, y
can only go as high as the

108
00:06:07,540 --> 00:06:09,800
radius in either direction.

109
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,570
So y is bounded between
minus r and r.

110
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:16,460
And so another way to look at
this graphically is you're

111
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:22,730
just taking this joint PDF and
squishing it to the y-axis.

112
00:06:22,730 --> 00:06:25,250

113
00:06:25,250 --> 00:06:28,510
And so the only parts that will
get nonzero contributions

114
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:31,590
are the ones from
r to minus r.

115
00:06:31,590 --> 00:06:34,920
And note that although the
original joint distribution

116
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,020
was uniform--

117
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:37,380
we assumed so--

118
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:40,860
when you take the marginal of
y, the marginal of y is not

119
00:06:40,860 --> 00:06:42,390
uniform, right?

120
00:06:42,390 --> 00:06:45,170
Notice that it actually
depends on y here.

121
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,080
And it varies depending
on what y is.

122
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:51,510
And it turns out that it will
be largest when y is 0 and

123
00:06:51,510 --> 00:06:54,190
smallest when y is
r or minus r.

124
00:06:54,190 --> 00:06:54,850
Why is that?

125
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:00,930
Because when you squish this,
you get more contribution when

126
00:07:00,930 --> 00:07:02,800
you're at y equals 0.

127
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,300
It's more likely for y to be 0
because there are a lot more

128
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,810
corresponding Xs that pair
with that y equals 0.

129
00:07:10,810 --> 00:07:13,870
And when you're all the way up
here, there are very few other

130
00:07:13,870 --> 00:07:17,230
Xs that will pair with that.

131
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:18,110
OK.

132
00:07:18,110 --> 00:07:25,850
So we found the marginal
distribution of Y. And now all

133
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:30,610
that's left to do is to
calculate out what this

134
00:07:30,610 --> 00:07:31,540
quotient is.

135
00:07:31,540 --> 00:07:34,330
So we have the joint
distribution.

136
00:07:34,330 --> 00:07:35,190
And we have the marginal.

137
00:07:35,190 --> 00:07:42,320
So let's just calculate out
what the conditional

138
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:45,540
distribution is.

139
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,130
OK.

140
00:07:46,130 --> 00:07:51,080
So the numerator is just
1 over the area.

141
00:07:51,080 --> 00:07:57,190

142
00:07:57,190 --> 00:08:02,060
And the denominator is this--

143
00:08:02,060 --> 00:08:07,690
2 times square root of r squared
minus y squared over

144
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,940
pi r squared.

145
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:11,610

146
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,590
And of course, we can do
some cancellations and

147
00:08:13,590 --> 00:08:14,840
simplifications.

148
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:16,390

149
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:20,850
But the first thing we want to
do is, as always, to check

150
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:24,240
what range this is
a valid for.

151
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,650
So the numerator is the
joint distribution.

152
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:33,030
And that's valid for any
x and y pairs that

153
00:08:33,030 --> 00:08:35,210
fall within the circle.

154
00:08:35,210 --> 00:08:38,669
And the bottom is valid
for any y that is

155
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:41,480
between minus r and r.

156
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:46,330
And so what this tells us is
that this is in fact valid for

157
00:08:46,330 --> 00:08:51,860
any pairs of x and y that
fall within this circle.

158
00:08:51,860 --> 00:09:00,440
So it's valid for x squared plus
y squared less than or

159
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:01,690
equal to r squared.

160
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:04,650

161
00:09:04,650 --> 00:09:07,300
And outside of it, it's 0.

162
00:09:07,300 --> 00:09:12,380

163
00:09:12,380 --> 00:09:16,410
And what we can do is simplify
this a little bit, right?

164
00:09:16,410 --> 00:09:22,380
Because this will cancel
out with the top.

165
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:27,760
And what we're left with is just
1 over 2 times the square

166
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,350
root of r squared
minus y squared.

167
00:09:31,350 --> 00:09:37,290
And note here now that for any
given conditioning on Y being

168
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:40,950
at some value little y, this
conditional density of X no

169
00:09:40,950 --> 00:09:42,710
longer depends on x.

170
00:09:42,710 --> 00:09:47,040
So it is in fact uniform
along a certain range.

171
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:55,690
So another way to write this
range that is maybe a little

172
00:09:55,690 --> 00:10:01,532
more explicit is that y has to
be between negative r and r.

173
00:10:01,532 --> 00:10:03,090
So that's what you're
conditioning on.

174
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,780
You know that y can only
be these values.

175
00:10:06,780 --> 00:10:10,600
And then given that Y is that
little y, then this is true

176
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:12,490
for some range of x.

177
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:16,630
So given that y is some value,
you know that x can only go

178
00:10:16,630 --> 00:10:23,220
from minus y squared minus y
squared to the positive square

179
00:10:23,220 --> 00:10:26,630
root of y squared minus y
squared minus square root of r

180
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:29,980
squared minus y squared less
than x less than equal to

181
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,890
square root of r squared
minus y squared.

182
00:10:31,890 --> 00:10:35,330
So it's doing the analogous
calculation as we did earlier.

183
00:10:35,330 --> 00:10:38,590

184
00:10:38,590 --> 00:10:43,450
And so what we see is that it
is in fact uniform, right?

185
00:10:43,450 --> 00:10:45,160
Because it doesn't
depend on x.

186
00:10:45,160 --> 00:10:46,460
And why is that?

187
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:49,635
It's because when you take
conditioning on Y being some

188
00:10:49,635 --> 00:10:53,100
little value it's, as we talked
about, it's as if

189
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:56,076
you're taking a slice
along that value.

190
00:10:56,076 --> 00:10:59,910
And now remember that the
original joint distribution

191
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:00,670
was uniform.

192
00:11:00,670 --> 00:11:03,480
So it was like a round
cake that was flat.

193
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:07,140
And now you take a slice of that
cake, a horizontal slice,

194
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,950
at some particular value of y.

195
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:12,640
Well, when you take that slice,
then you know that, if

196
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,020
you can imagine it coming
out of the board, this

197
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:18,970
distribution of X will
also be still flat.

198
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:22,270
So the distribution of X
will still be uniform.

199
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:24,150
And that's what you get here.

200
00:11:24,150 --> 00:11:26,400
So it's interesting
that the original

201
00:11:26,400 --> 00:11:28,390
distribution is uniform.

202
00:11:28,390 --> 00:11:30,870
But when you marginalize it
and take the marginal

203
00:11:30,870 --> 00:11:34,530
distribution of Y, you get
something that is not uniform,

204
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:35,990
where it depends on y.

205
00:11:35,990 --> 00:11:39,730
And by symmetry, you can say
that when you marginalize out

206
00:11:39,730 --> 00:11:42,910
y and take the marginal
distribution of just X, you

207
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,320
will also see that the marginal
distribution of X is

208
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:47,320
also not uniform.

209
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:50,820
But when you then calculate the
conditional distribution,

210
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:53,580
you get a uniform distribution
back again.

211
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:56,730
And that's because you're taking
this slice, right?

212
00:11:56,730 --> 00:12:05,150
The reason is that, depending on
where the slice is, you get

213
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:06,450
a longer slice.

214
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:09,840
And because of that, the
marginal distribution becomes

215
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:16,030
higher closer to the axis
and smaller when

216
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,430
you go to the extremes.

217
00:12:17,430 --> 00:12:21,170
But as long as you know and you
condition on just taking

218
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:23,390
some slice, within
that slice, the

219
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:25,776
distribution will be uniform.

220
00:12:25,776 --> 00:12:26,190
OK.

221
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,890
So this is just a slightly
different kind of joint

222
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:32,570
distribution with a
circular shape.

223
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:36,500
Mostly we've been dealing more
with kind of angular

224
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,440
distributions.

225
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,580
And so you can see that even
with circular distributions,

226
00:12:39,580 --> 00:12:40,730
you get something.

227
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:43,430
You can still apply the same
kind of methodologies and

228
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,715
tools to get the answers
that you want.

229
00:12:45,715 --> 00:12:46,140
All right.

230
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:47,380
So I hope that was helpful.

231
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:48,630
And we'll see you next time.

232
00:12:48,630 --> 00:12:49,690
