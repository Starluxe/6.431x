1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,390

2
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,170
Hi.

3
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:03,250
In this problem, we'll get some
practice working with

4
00:00:03,250 --> 00:00:08,000
PDFs and also using PDFs
to calculate CDFs.

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,170
So the PDF that we're given
in this problem is here.

6
00:00:11,170 --> 00:00:13,390
So we have a random variable,
Z, which is a continuous

7
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:14,250
random variable.

8
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:17,550
And we're told that the PDF of
this random variable, Z, is

9
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:21,790
given by gamma times 1 plus z
squared in the range of z

10
00:00:21,790 --> 00:00:23,480
between negative 2 and 1.

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,520
And outside of this
range, it's 0.

12
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:29,850
All right, so first thing we
need to do and the first part

13
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:32,420
of this problem is we need to
figure out what gamma is

14
00:00:32,420 --> 00:00:35,250
because it's not really a
fully specified PDF yet.

15
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:37,490
We need to figure out exactly
what the value gamma is.

16
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:38,620
And how do we do that?

17
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,670
Well, we've done analogous
things before for

18
00:00:40,670 --> 00:00:42,360
the discrete case.

19
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,200
So the tool that we use
is that the PDF must

20
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:47,130
integrate to 1.

21
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:50,240
So in the discrete case, the
analogy was that the PMF had

22
00:00:50,240 --> 00:00:52,140
to sum to 1.

23
00:00:52,140 --> 00:00:53,150
So what do we know?

24
00:00:53,150 --> 00:00:56,380
We know that when you integrate
this PDF from

25
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:04,330
negative infinity to infinity,
fZ of z, it has to equal 1.

26
00:01:04,330 --> 00:01:07,050
All right, so what
do we do now?

27
00:01:07,050 --> 00:01:09,300
Well, we know what
the PDF is--

28
00:01:09,300 --> 00:01:11,880
partially, except for gamma--
so let's plug that in.

29
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:15,150
And the first thing that we'll
do is we'll simplify this

30
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:20,440
because we know that the PDF is
actually only non-zero in

31
00:01:20,440 --> 00:01:21,580
the range negative 2 to 1.

32
00:01:21,580 --> 00:01:23,900
So instead of integrating from
negative infinity to infinity,

33
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:26,580
we'll just integrate from
negative 2 to 1.

34
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:30,190
And now let's plug in
this gamma times 1

35
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:34,380
plus z squared dz.

36
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:36,610
And now the rest of the problem
is just applying

37
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:38,350
calculus and integrating this.

38
00:01:38,350 --> 00:01:42,480
So let's just go through
that process.

39
00:01:42,480 --> 00:01:50,720
So we get z plus 1/3 z cubed
from minus 2 to 1.

40
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:53,340
And now we'll plug
in the limits.

41
00:01:53,340 --> 00:02:02,280
And we get gamma, and that's 1
plus 1/3 minus minus 2 plus

42
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,816
1/3 times minus 2 cubed.

43
00:02:04,816 --> 00:02:08,470

44
00:02:08,470 --> 00:02:13,980
And then if we add this all up,
you get 4/3 plus 2 plus

45
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,130
8/3, which will give you 6.

46
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,280
So what we end up with
in the end is that 1

47
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:23,690
is equal to 6 gamma.

48
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,640
So what does that tell us?

49
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,110
That tells us that, in this
case, gamma is 1/6.

50
00:02:29,110 --> 00:02:32,030

51
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:37,420
OK, so we've actually figured
out what this PDF really is.

52
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:41,870
And let's just substitute
that in.

53
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,610
So we know what gamma is.

54
00:02:46,610 --> 00:02:48,970
So it's 1/6.

55
00:02:48,970 --> 00:02:52,190
So from this PDF, we can
calculate anything

56
00:02:52,190 --> 00:02:53,430
that we want to.

57
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:56,930
This PDF, basically, fully
specifies everything that we

58
00:02:56,930 --> 00:02:59,820
need to know about this random
variable, Z. And one of the

59
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:03,520
things that we can calculate
from the PDF is the CDF.

60
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:05,830
So the next part of the
problem asks us to

61
00:03:05,830 --> 00:03:07,460
calculate the CDF.

62
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:13,350
So remember the CDF, we use
capital F. And the definition

63
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:19,630
is that you integrate from
negative infinity to this z.

64
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,650
And what do you integrate?

65
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:22,120
You integrate the PDF.

66
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,580
And all use some dummy variable,
y, here in the

67
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:28,420
integration.

68
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,510
So what is it really doing?

69
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,130
It's basically just taking the
PDF and taking everything to

70
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:33,650
the left of it.

71
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:38,920
So another way to think about
this-- this is the probability

72
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:42,290
that the random variable
is less than or equal

73
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:44,620
to some little z.

74
00:03:44,620 --> 00:03:48,020
It's just accumulating
probability as you go from

75
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:49,270
left to right.

76
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,580

77
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:54,120
So the hardest part about
calculating the CDFs, really,

78
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:59,710
is actually just keeping track
of the ranges, because unless

79
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:03,340
the PDF is really simple, you'll
have cases where the

80
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:06,820
PDF could be 0 in some ranges
and non-zero in other ranges.

81
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:09,710
And then what you really have
to keep track of is where

82
00:04:09,710 --> 00:04:12,800
those ranges are and where you
actually have non-zero

83
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:14,040
probability.

84
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:17,120
So in this case, we actually
break things down into three

85
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:21,370
different ranges because
this PDF actually looks

86
00:04:21,370 --> 00:04:24,600
something like this.

87
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:31,060
So it's non-zero between
negative 2 and 1, and it's 0

88
00:04:31,060 --> 00:04:33,250
everywhere else.

89
00:04:33,250 --> 00:04:35,700
So then what that means is
that our job is a little

90
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:40,070
simpler because everything to
the left of negative 2, the

91
00:04:40,070 --> 00:04:42,510
CDF will be 0 because there's
no probability

92
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:44,190
density to the left.

93
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:49,710
And then everything to the
right of 1, well we've

94
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:52,780
accumulated all the probability
in the PDF because

95
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:55,640
we know that when you integrate
from negative 2 to

96
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,060
1, you capture everything.

97
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:00,510
So anything to the right of
1, the CDF will be 1.

98
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:05,370
So the only hard part is
calculating what the CDF is in

99
00:05:05,370 --> 00:05:08,390
this intermediate range, between
negative 2 and 1.

100
00:05:08,390 --> 00:05:10,300
So let's do that case first--

101
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:17,910
so the case of z is between
negative 2 and 1.

102
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:22,850

103
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,980
So what is the CDF
in that case?

104
00:05:24,980 --> 00:05:32,690
Well, the definition is to
integrate from negative

105
00:05:32,690 --> 00:05:34,190
infinity to z.

106
00:05:34,190 --> 00:05:37,610
But we know that everything
to the left of negative 2,

107
00:05:37,610 --> 00:05:39,010
there's no probably density.

108
00:05:39,010 --> 00:05:40,550
So we don't need to
include that.

109
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,340
So we can actually change this
lower limit to negative 2.

110
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:48,500
And the upper limit is
wherever this z is.

111
00:05:48,500 --> 00:05:51,410
So that becomes our integral.

112
00:05:51,410 --> 00:05:53,560
And the inside is
still the PDF.

113
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,550
So let's just plug that in.

114
00:05:56,550 --> 00:06:00,680
We know that it's 1/6 1 plus--

115
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:04,620
we'll make this y squared--

116
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:07,130
by.

117
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:09,910
And now it's just
calculus again.

118
00:06:09,910 --> 00:06:12,800
And in fact, it's more or less
the same integral, so what we

119
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:22,370
get is y plus 1/3 y cubed
from negative 2 to z.

120
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:24,760
Notice the only thing that's
different here is that we're

121
00:06:24,760 --> 00:06:30,180
integrating from negative 2 to
z instead of negative 2 to 1.

122
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:37,360
And when we calculate this out,
what we get is z plus 1/3

123
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:48,520
z cubed minus minus 2 plus 1/3
minus 2 cubed, which gives us

124
00:06:48,520 --> 00:07:01,976
1/6 z plus 1/3 z cubed plus plus
2 plus 8/3 gives us 14/3.

125
00:07:01,976 --> 00:07:06,470

126
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:10,730
So that actually is our CDF
between the range of

127
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:12,660
negative 2 to 1.

128
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:15,450
So for full completeness, let's
actually write out the

129
00:07:15,450 --> 00:07:20,950
entire CDF, because there's two
other parts in the CDF.

130
00:07:20,950 --> 00:07:26,380
So the first part is that
it's 0 if z is less

131
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:28,530
than negative 2.

132
00:07:28,530 --> 00:07:34,850
And it's 1 if z is
greater than 1.

133
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:37,190
And in between, it's this
thing that we've just

134
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:37,340
calculated.

135
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:55,240
So it's 1/6 z plus 1/3 z cubed
plus 14/3 if z is between

136
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:58,410
minus 2 and 1.

137
00:07:58,410 --> 00:08:00,650
So that is our final answer.

138
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:03,170

139
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:07,400
So the main point of this
problem was to drill a little

140
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:10,400
bit more the concepts
of PDFs and CDFs.

141
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,320
So for the PDF, the important
thing to remember is that in

142
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,970
order to be a valid PDF, the
PDF has to integrate to 1.

143
00:08:16,970 --> 00:08:19,790
And you can use that fact to
help you calculate any unknown

144
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,450
constants in the PDF.

145
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:24,980
And then to calculate the CDF,
it's just integrating the PDF

146
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:27,490
from negative infinity to
whatever point that you want

147
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:28,290
to cut off at.

148
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:31,270
And the tricky part, as I said
earlier, was really just

149
00:08:31,270 --> 00:08:32,230
keeping track of the ranges.

150
00:08:32,230 --> 00:08:34,159
In this case, we've broke it
down into three ranges.

151
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,120
If we had a slightly more
complicated PDF, then you

152
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:40,710
would have to keep track
of even more ranges.

153
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,429
All right, so I hope that
was helpful, and we'll

154
00:08:42,429 --> 00:08:43,679
see you next time.

155
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:44,579
