1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,510

2
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,950
In this segment, we will look
at the famous example, which

3
00:00:03,950 --> 00:00:08,990
was posed by Comte de Buffon,
a French naturalist back in

4
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:11,510
the 18th century.

5
00:00:11,510 --> 00:00:14,820
And it marks the beginning of a
subject that is known as the

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:18,180
subject of geometric
probability.

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,440
The problem is pretty simple.

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:22,400
We have the infinite plane.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,710
And we draw lines that are
parallel to each other.

10
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:31,080
And they are spaced
apart d units.

11
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,680
So this distance here is d.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,160
And the same for all
the other lines.

13
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,010
We take a needle that has
a certain length, l.

14
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:44,210
And we throw it at random
on the plane.

15
00:00:44,210 --> 00:00:48,080
So the needle might fall
this way, so that it

16
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:49,590
doesn't cross any line.

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,360
Or it might fall this way, so
that it ends up crossing one

18
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,910
of the lines.

19
00:00:55,910 --> 00:00:59,590
If the needle is long enough, it
might actually even end up

20
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,760
crossing two of the lines.

21
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:04,830
But we will make the assumption
that the length of

22
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:08,990
the needle is less than
the distance between

23
00:01:08,990 --> 00:01:10,570
two adjacent lines.

24
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:13,940
So that we're going to have
either this configuration or

25
00:01:13,940 --> 00:01:16,020
that configuration.

26
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:19,470
So in this setting, we're
interested in the question of

27
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:22,630
how likely is it that the needle
is going to intersect

28
00:01:22,630 --> 00:01:25,610
one of the lines if the
needle is thrown

29
00:01:25,610 --> 00:01:27,890
completely at random?

30
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:29,860
We will answer this question.

31
00:01:29,860 --> 00:01:31,590
And we will proceed
as follows.

32
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:36,300
First, we need to model the
probabilistic experiment

33
00:01:36,300 --> 00:01:37,330
mathematically.

34
00:01:37,330 --> 00:01:40,860
That is, we need to define an
appropriate sample space,

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:44,220
define some relevant random
variables, choose an

36
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:47,550
appropriate probability law,
identify the event of

37
00:01:47,550 --> 00:01:50,690
interest, and then
calculate it.

38
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,130
Let us see what it takes to
describe a typical outcome of

39
00:01:54,130 --> 00:01:55,560
the experiment.

40
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:59,770
Suppose that the needle
fell this way.

41
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:03,690
So that the nearest line
is the one above.

42
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,460
And let us mark here the
center of the needle.

43
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:12,980
One quantity of interest is this
vertical distance between

44
00:02:12,980 --> 00:02:15,840
the needle and the
nearest line.

45
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,260
Let us call this quantity x.

46
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:20,950

47
00:02:20,950 --> 00:02:24,220
We're using here a lowercase x,
because we're dealing with

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,250
a numerical value in one
particular outcome of the

49
00:02:28,250 --> 00:02:29,450
experiment.

50
00:02:29,450 --> 00:02:32,720
But we think of this x as being
the realization of a

51
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,530
certain random variable that we
we'll denote by capital X.

52
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:40,630
What else does it take to
describe the needle?

53
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:44,160
Suppose that the needle had
fallen somewhere, so that it

54
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,850
is at the same vertical distance
from the nearest

55
00:02:46,850 --> 00:02:54,000
line, but it has an orientation
of this kind.

56
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,090
This orientation compared to
that one should make a

57
00:02:58,090 --> 00:02:59,140
difference.

58
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:02,430
Because when it falls that way,
it's more likely that

59
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:06,940
it's going to cut the next line,
as opposed to this case.

60
00:03:06,940 --> 00:03:11,330
So the angle that the needle
is making with the parallel

61
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:14,430
lines should also be relevant.

62
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:17,780
So let us give a name to
that particular angle.

63
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:20,770
So let's extend that
line until it

64
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:24,560
crosses one of the lines.

65
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,640
And let us give a name to this
angle, and call it theta.

66
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,280
So if I tell you x and theta,
you know how far away the

67
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,370
needle is from the nearest line,
and at what angle it is.

68
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:42,780
It looks like these are two
useful variables to describe

69
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:44,210
the outcome of the experiment.

70
00:03:44,210 --> 00:03:46,520
So let us try to working
with these.

71
00:03:46,520 --> 00:03:49,940
So our model is going to involve
two random variables,

72
00:03:49,940 --> 00:03:54,660
defined the way we discussed
just now.

73
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,270
What is the range of these
random variables?

74
00:03:59,270 --> 00:04:04,360
Since we took x to be the
distance from the nearest

75
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,690
line, and the lines are d units
apart, this means that x

76
00:04:10,690 --> 00:04:17,940
is going to be somewhere
between 0 and d over 2.

77
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:20,420
How about theta?

78
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:24,590
So the needle makes two angles
with the parallel line.

79
00:04:24,590 --> 00:04:27,670
It's this angle, and the
complementary one.

80
00:04:27,670 --> 00:04:28,920
Which one do we take?

81
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:32,120
Well, we use the convention that
theta is defined as the

82
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,490
acute angle that the direction
of the needle is

83
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,110
making with the lines.

84
00:04:37,110 --> 00:04:44,680
So that theta will vary over a
range from 0 to pi over 2.

85
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:47,980

86
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:52,060
And our sample space for the
experiment will be the set of

87
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,130
all pairs of x and theta that
satisfy these two conditions.

88
00:04:58,130 --> 00:05:01,740
These will be the possible
x's and thetas.

89
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:06,160
Having defined the sample space,
next we need to define

90
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,150
a probability law.

91
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:10,730
At this point, we do not want
to make any arbitrary

92
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:11,850
assumptions.

93
00:05:11,850 --> 00:05:16,870
We only have the words
completely at random to go by.

94
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:19,180
But what do these words mean?

95
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,660
We will interpret them to
mean that there are

96
00:05:21,660 --> 00:05:24,910
no preferred x values.

97
00:05:24,910 --> 00:05:28,830
So that's all x values are, in
some sense, equally likely.

98
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:31,290
So we're going to assume
that X is a

99
00:05:31,290 --> 00:05:33,820
uniform random variable.

100
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:36,750
Since it is uniform, it's going
to be a constant over

101
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:37,520
this range.

102
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,750
And in order to integrate to 1,
that constants will have to

103
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:42,500
be 2 over d.

104
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:47,110
And we understand that the PDF
of X is 0 outside that range.

105
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:49,950
Similarly, for theta that we
do not want to assume that

106
00:05:49,950 --> 00:05:52,680
some orientations are more
likely than other

107
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,900
orientations.

108
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,230
So we will again assume
a uniform probability

109
00:05:57,230 --> 00:05:59,510
distribution.

110
00:05:59,510 --> 00:06:05,450
And therefore that PDF must be
equal to 2 over pi for thetas

111
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:08,240
over this particular range.

112
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,800
So far we have specified the
marginal PDF's for each one of

113
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:13,530
the two random variables.

114
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:15,700
How about their joint PDF?

115
00:06:15,700 --> 00:06:18,640
In order to have a complete
model, we need to have a joint

116
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:20,500
PDF in our hands.

117
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,280
Here, we're going to make the
assumption that X and THETA

118
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,610
are independent of each other.

119
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:30,780
And in that case, the joint
PDF is determined by just

120
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:34,360
taking the product of
the marginal PDF's.

121
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:38,050
So the joint PDF is going
to be equal to 4

122
00:06:38,050 --> 00:06:41,960
divided by pi times d.

123
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:44,860
By this point, we have
completely specified the

124
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:47,630
probabilistic model.

125
00:06:47,630 --> 00:06:50,970
We have made some assumptions,
which you might

126
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:52,890
even consider arbitrary.

127
00:06:52,890 --> 00:06:57,060
But these assumptions are
a reasonable attempt at

128
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,720
capturing the idea that
the needle is thrown

129
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:02,620
completely at random.

130
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:07,120
This completes the subjective
part, the modeling part.

131
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,370
The next step is much
more streamlined.

132
00:07:11,370 --> 00:07:13,950
There's not going to
be any choices.

133
00:07:13,950 --> 00:07:18,370
We just need to consider the
event of interest, express it

134
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:21,170
in terms of the random variables
that we have in our

135
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:25,210
hands, and then you use the
probability model that we have

136
00:07:25,210 --> 00:07:28,890
to calculate the probability
of this particular event.

137
00:07:28,890 --> 00:07:32,910
So let us identify the
event of interest.

138
00:07:32,910 --> 00:07:38,930
When will the needle intersect
the nearest line?

139
00:07:38,930 --> 00:07:42,910
This will depend on
the following.

140
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:48,100
We can look at the vertical
extent of the needle.

141
00:07:48,100 --> 00:07:51,580
By vertical extent, I
mean the following.

142
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,790
Let's see how far the needle
goes in the vertical

143
00:07:55,790 --> 00:08:04,750
direction, which is the length
of this green segment here.

144
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:10,390
In this example, the vertical
extent of the needle is less

145
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,630
than the distance from
the next line.

146
00:08:13,630 --> 00:08:17,106
And we do not have
an intersection.

147
00:08:17,106 --> 00:08:23,800
If the figure was something like
this, the vertical extent

148
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:29,710
of the needle would have been
that, but x would have been

149
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:32,650
just this little segment.

150
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:35,860
The vertical extent
is bigger than x.

151
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:38,440
And the needle intersects
the line.

152
00:08:38,440 --> 00:08:43,700
So we have an intersection if
and only if the vertical

153
00:08:43,700 --> 00:08:49,920
extent, which is this vertical
green segment, is larger than

154
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,440
the distance x.

155
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,920
Or, equivalently, if x is less
than the vertical extent.

156
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,550
So we will have an intersection
if x is less than

157
00:09:02,550 --> 00:09:06,780
or equal to the vertical
extent of the needle.

158
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:10,110
Now how big is this
vertical extent?

159
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:12,390
Let's use some trigonometry
here.

160
00:09:12,390 --> 00:09:14,180
This angle here is theta.

161
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:17,485
So this angle here
is also theta.

162
00:09:17,485 --> 00:09:20,020

163
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:22,140
Here we have a right triangle.

164
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:29,220
And the hypotenuse of this
triangle is l over 2.

165
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:31,480
This angle is theta.

166
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:38,160
Therefore this vertical segment
is equal to l over 2

167
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,890
times the sine theta.

168
00:09:41,890 --> 00:09:45,540
So this is the geometrical
condition that describes the

169
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:50,730
event that the needle intersects
the nearest line.

170
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:53,880
And all we need to do now is to
calculate the probability

171
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,130
of this event.

172
00:09:55,130 --> 00:09:59,150

173
00:09:59,150 --> 00:10:01,790
So here's what we have so far.

174
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:05,170
This is the picture that we
had before, but drawn in a

175
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:07,010
somewhat nicer way.

176
00:10:07,010 --> 00:10:10,910
This is the joint PDF that
we decided upon.

177
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:14,510
And we wish to calculate the
probability of this particular

178
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:20,170
event, that is less than or
equal to l over 2 sine THETA.

179
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,450

180
00:10:23,450 --> 00:10:27,150
How do we calculate the
probability of an event that

181
00:10:27,150 --> 00:10:29,720
has to do with two
random variables?

182
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:35,890
What we do is we take the joint
PDF, which in our case

183
00:10:35,890 --> 00:10:45,590
is 4 over pi d, and integrate
it over the set of x's and

184
00:10:45,590 --> 00:10:51,110
thetas for which the
PDF is non-zero.

185
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,030
So it's only going to
be over x's and

186
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:55,250
thetas in those ranges.

187
00:10:55,250 --> 00:10:59,740
And also only for those x theta
pairs for which the

188
00:10:59,740 --> 00:11:01,350
event occurs.

189
00:11:01,350 --> 00:11:03,780
So what are these pairs?

190
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:08,200
This event can occur with
any choice of theta.

191
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:15,950
So theta is free to vary
from 0 to pi over 2.

192
00:11:15,950 --> 00:11:17,510
How about x?

193
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:23,290
For this event to occur, x
can be anything that is

194
00:11:23,290 --> 00:11:27,120
non-negative, as long as
it is less than or

195
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,380
equal to this number.

196
00:11:29,380 --> 00:11:33,590
So the upper limit of this
integration is going to be l

197
00:11:33,590 --> 00:11:38,670
over 2 times sine theta.

198
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:40,170
And all we need to do now is to

199
00:11:40,170 --> 00:11:42,580
evaluate this double integral.

200
00:11:42,580 --> 00:11:45,490
Let's start with the
inner integral.

201
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:50,230
Because we're just integrating a
constant, the inner integral

202
00:11:50,230 --> 00:12:00,270
evaluates to the constant we're
integrating, which is 4

203
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:04,190
times pi d, times the length
of the interval over which

204
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,780
we're integrating, which
is l over 2 sine theta.

205
00:12:07,780 --> 00:12:12,310

206
00:12:12,310 --> 00:12:15,880
And now we need to carry
out the outer integral.

207
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:19,940
Let us pull out the constants,
which is this 4 with

208
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,220
this 2 give us 2.

209
00:12:22,220 --> 00:12:27,100
We have 2l over pi d.

210
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:31,310
And then the integral from 0
to pi over 2 of sine theta.

211
00:12:31,310 --> 00:12:35,390
Now the integral of sine theta
is minus cosine theta.

212
00:12:35,390 --> 00:12:39,150
And we need to evaluate this
at 0 and pi over 2.

213
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:41,470
This turns out to
be equal to 1.

214
00:12:41,470 --> 00:12:44,610
So the final result
is 2l over pi d.

215
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:47,280

216
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:50,440
And this is the final answer
to the problem that we have

217
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,690
been considering.

218
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:53,590

219
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:57,610
And now, a curious thought.

220
00:12:57,610 --> 00:13:03,230
Suppose that you do not know
what the number pi is.

221
00:13:03,230 --> 00:13:09,110
And all you have in your hands
is your floor, lines drawn on

222
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:11,390
your floor, and the needle.

223
00:13:11,390 --> 00:13:13,860
And you do know the length
between adjacent

224
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:15,390
lines on your floor.

225
00:13:15,390 --> 00:13:17,960
And you do know your length
of your needle.

226
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:20,990
How can you figure out
the number pi?

227
00:13:20,990 --> 00:13:22,200
Take your needle.

228
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:25,020
Throw it at random,
a million times.

229
00:13:25,020 --> 00:13:29,030
And count the frequency with
which the needle ends up

230
00:13:29,030 --> 00:13:30,640
crossing the line.

231
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:32,500
If you believe that
probabilities can be

232
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:37,520
interpreted as frequencies, the
frequency that you observe

233
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:40,490
gives you a good estimate
of this probability.

234
00:13:40,490 --> 00:13:42,710
So it gives you a
good estimate of

235
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:44,460
this particular number.

236
00:13:44,460 --> 00:13:47,270
And if you know the length of
your needle, and of the

237
00:13:47,270 --> 00:13:50,910
distance between the different
lines, you can use the

238
00:13:50,910 --> 00:13:55,580
estimate of that number to
determine the value of pi.

239
00:13:55,580 --> 00:14:00,300
This is a so-called Monte
Carlo method, which uses

240
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:04,180
simulation to evaluate
experimentally the value, in

241
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:07,630
this case, of the
constant, pi.

242
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:10,620
Of course, for pi, we have
much better ways of

243
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,140
calculating it.

244
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:14,340
But there are many applications
in engineering

245
00:14:14,340 --> 00:14:16,070
and in physics where certain

246
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:18,320
quantities are hard to calculate.

247
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,910
But they can be calculated using
a trick of this kind of

248
00:14:22,910 --> 00:14:24,630
by simulation.

249
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:26,810
Here's a typical situation.

250
00:14:26,810 --> 00:14:29,400
Consider the unit cube.

251
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,770
And for simplicity, I'm only
taking a cube in two

252
00:14:32,770 --> 00:14:33,550
dimensions.

253
00:14:33,550 --> 00:14:37,340
But in general, think of the
unit cube in n dimensions

254
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:40,300
which is an object that's
has unit volume.

255
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:46,810
Inside that unit cube, there is
a complicated subset, which

256
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:50,880
is described maybe by some very
complicated formulas.

257
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,020
And you want to calculate
the volume of

258
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:55,990
this complicated subset.

259
00:14:55,990 --> 00:14:59,340
The description of the subset
is so complicated that using

260
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,830
integration, multiple integrals,
and calculus is

261
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:05,230
practically impossible.

262
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,680
What can you do?

263
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:10,990
What you can do is to start
throwing, at random, points

264
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:13,250
inside that unit cube.

265
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,390
So you throw points.

266
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:15,570
Some fall inside.

267
00:15:15,570 --> 00:15:17,980
Some fall outside.

268
00:15:17,980 --> 00:15:21,410
You count the frequency with
which is the points happened

269
00:15:21,410 --> 00:15:24,430
to be inside your set.

270
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:30,260
And as long as you're throwing
the points uniformly over the

271
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:37,220
cube, then the probability of
your complicated set is going

272
00:15:37,220 --> 00:15:39,870
to be the volume of that set.

273
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:43,250
You estimated a probability by
counting the frequency with

274
00:15:43,250 --> 00:15:46,860
which you get points
into that set.

275
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:51,350
And so, by using these observed
frequencies, you can

276
00:15:51,350 --> 00:15:56,620
estimate the volume of a sets,
something that might be very

277
00:15:56,620 --> 00:15:59,990
difficult to do through other
numerical methods.

278
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:04,770
It turns out that these days
physicists and many engineers

279
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:09,410
use methods of this kind quite
often, and in many important

280
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,660
applications.

281
00:16:10,660 --> 00:16:11,000
