1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,270

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:04,190
In this segment, we will go
through a quite representative

3
00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:07,460
application of the Bayes rule
to a situation that involves

4
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:09,490
two continuous random
variables.

5
00:00:09,490 --> 00:00:10,790
The setting is as follows.

6
00:00:10,790 --> 00:00:14,410
We start with two independent
random variables, and we get

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:17,510
to observe the sum of the two.

8
00:00:17,510 --> 00:00:20,470
So for example, we might
have a signal.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:23,890
That signal is transmitted
through some medium, and so it

10
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,910
is corrupted by noise, called
the noise Y. And we get to

11
00:00:27,910 --> 00:00:32,280
observe Z. On the basis of the
observed value of Z, we would

12
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:37,440
like to say as much as we can
about the unknown signal, X.

13
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,150
How do we approach this?

14
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:44,090
Well, we will try to find the
conditional distribution of X

15
00:00:44,090 --> 00:00:47,950
given the value z of the signal
that we have observed.

16
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:51,040
How do we calculate this
conditional distribution?

17
00:00:51,040 --> 00:00:53,570
The setting here suggests
that we should be

18
00:00:53,570 --> 00:00:55,380
using the Bayes rule.

19
00:00:55,380 --> 00:00:57,750
So let's just write down the
formula for the Bayes rule

20
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,410
that we already have.

21
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,030
On the other hand, this formula
does not quite fit the

22
00:01:02,030 --> 00:01:03,190
setting here.

23
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:06,970
This is the formula that would
be applicable if we were to

24
00:01:06,970 --> 00:01:10,400
observe Y and try to say
something about X.

25
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,770
But here we're observing Z.
We're not observing Y. What

26
00:01:13,770 --> 00:01:15,110
should we do?

27
00:01:15,110 --> 00:01:16,150
It's very simple.

28
00:01:16,150 --> 00:01:17,470
Just use the same formula.

29
00:01:17,470 --> 00:01:20,780
But instead of having
y's, use z's.

30
00:01:20,780 --> 00:01:24,720
So the formula takes this
equivalent form.

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,580
So this is what we want
to calculate--

32
00:01:27,580 --> 00:01:31,630
the conditional distribution of
X given an observed value

33
00:01:31,630 --> 00:01:37,040
of Z. In general, we will be
given the distribution of X.

34
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,320
So this would be a
known quantity.

35
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:40,840
But how about this?

36
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,700
We need the conditional
distribution of Z given X. In

37
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:49,810
other words, we essentially
need a model of how the

38
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:52,890
observations, z, are
constructed.

39
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:57,300
We're talking about a model of
this box that tells us, given

40
00:01:57,300 --> 00:02:01,550
a value of X, what are
the properties of Z?

41
00:02:01,550 --> 00:02:05,160
Suppose that instead, however,
all that we have in our hands

42
00:02:05,160 --> 00:02:09,680
is the distribution of Y and the
knowledge that X and Y are

43
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,729
independent.

44
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,560
Somehow we need to use this
information to find the

45
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,270
distribution of Z. So
let us start working

46
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,600
towards this goal.

47
00:02:20,600 --> 00:02:24,210
We can figure out what the
answer will be quite

48
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,132
intuitively if I tell you that
capital X takes a value of

49
00:02:29,132 --> 00:02:34,000
little x, then in this
conditional universe, Z is

50
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,110
going to be just this
random variable.

51
00:02:36,110 --> 00:02:38,680

52
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:42,270
And this is the same as the
random variable, capital Y,

53
00:02:42,270 --> 00:02:46,530
except that a constant is added
to that random variable.

54
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:50,930
So Z is going to have the same
distribution as Y, except that

55
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:56,020
it gets shifted by an amount
of little X. So it has the

56
00:02:56,020 --> 00:03:00,190
same distribution as
Y, except that the

57
00:03:00,190 --> 00:03:02,500
distribution is shifted.

58
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:05,540
So instead of having an argument
z here, we will need

59
00:03:05,540 --> 00:03:08,710
to have an argument z minus x.

60
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:11,720
So this corresponds to taking
the distribution of Y and

61
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,260
shifting it by x.

62
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,240
Another way to think about why
this argument, z minus x, here

63
00:03:18,240 --> 00:03:22,700
is correct, notice that in
order for capital Z to be

64
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:28,350
equal to some little z, then
capital Y should be

65
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:31,530
equal to z minus x.

66
00:03:31,530 --> 00:03:37,880
This is the value of Y that
makes the sum of x and y turn

67
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:41,660
out to be the same
as little z.

68
00:03:41,660 --> 00:03:45,620
So intuitively, this is what
we would get for the

69
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:49,370
conditional density of Z. And
then we could just apply this

70
00:03:49,370 --> 00:03:51,110
form of the Bayes rule.

71
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:56,210
It's instructive, though, to
re-derive this relation here

72
00:03:56,210 --> 00:03:59,640
in a different and somewhat
more formal way.

73
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:02,060
So let us go through one
more derivation.

74
00:04:02,060 --> 00:04:06,710
This time we will give an
argument that relies on CDFs.

75
00:04:06,710 --> 00:04:08,120
And here's how it goes.

76
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:11,150
We will first find the
cumulative distribution

77
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:16,430
function of Z conditioned on X.
That is, we will attempt to

78
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:19,335
calculate this conditional
probability.

79
00:04:19,335 --> 00:04:21,980

80
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:26,450
And then, since this is a
conditional CDF, we would then

81
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:30,300
take derivatives to find
conditional PDF.

82
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,730
This probability, by definition,
Z is X plus Y. So

83
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:39,270
we have this probability
conditioned on X

84
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,700
equal to little x.

85
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:46,800
But if we know that capital X
takes a value of little x,

86
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:51,850
then this capital X here can be
replaced just by little x.

87
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:57,570
And we obtain this
probability here.

88
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:01,260
Now, this is an expression,
which is a random variable,

89
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:03,430
because Y is random.

90
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:05,860
But little x is a number.

91
00:05:05,860 --> 00:05:09,530
So Y is the only random variable
involved here.

92
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,100
Y is independent from X. So the
conditional distribution

93
00:05:14,100 --> 00:05:18,240
given the value of capital X
should be the same as the

94
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:19,700
unconditional distribution.

95
00:05:19,700 --> 00:05:24,380

96
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:28,000
And finally, we can rewrite
this event in this form--

97
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,490
the probability of capital
Y being less than or

98
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:33,690
equal to z minus x.

99
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:36,180
And we recognize that here
we have the cumulative

100
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:44,930
distribution of Y, but evaluated
at little z minus x.

101
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:48,730
Here we have the cumulative of
the conditional distribution

102
00:05:48,730 --> 00:05:51,030
of Z given X.

103
00:05:51,030 --> 00:05:55,950
We take the derivative of this
quantity to find the density

104
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:59,410
of the conditional distribution
of Z given X. And

105
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:03,100
that density has to be equal to
the derivative of this side

106
00:06:03,100 --> 00:06:04,580
of the equation.

107
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:09,480
And the derivative here with
respect to z is just the

108
00:06:09,480 --> 00:06:18,790
density of Y evaluated
at z minus x.

109
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:23,500
So we have verified, using a
second method, that this

110
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,080
formula here is correct.

111
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:27,750

112
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:30,950
So here's a summary of what
we have done so far.

113
00:06:30,950 --> 00:06:34,070
We basically wrote down the
form of the Bayes rule.

114
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:38,040
And we wrote down how the
distribution of Z can be

115
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:40,990
expressed in terms of the
distribution of Y.

116
00:06:40,990 --> 00:06:44,570
And so we now have available
an expression for this term

117
00:06:44,570 --> 00:06:46,730
that appears in the numerator.

118
00:06:46,730 --> 00:06:48,410
Now, let us look at the
concrete example.

119
00:06:48,410 --> 00:06:52,840
Suppose that X and Y are
exponential random variables,

120
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:56,720
with a common parameter,
lambda.

121
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,520
How are we to think about
this situation?

122
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:01,930
We start at time zero.

123
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:03,820
We have a light bulb.

124
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:07,590
We wait until a light
bulb burns out.

125
00:07:07,590 --> 00:07:10,100
And the time until a light
bulb burns out is

126
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:13,070
exponentially distributed with
some parameter lambda.

127
00:07:13,070 --> 00:07:16,220
Then we start using
a new light bulb.

128
00:07:16,220 --> 00:07:19,840
And that light bulb will also
remain alive for a random

129
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,110
amount of time.

130
00:07:21,110 --> 00:07:22,470
Call it Y.

131
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:26,340
And at that time, the second
light bulb burns out as well.

132
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:31,120
The total amount of time that
has elapsed, we call it Z.

133
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,660
Somebody tells you the value of
Z. That's when the second

134
00:07:34,660 --> 00:07:37,100
light bulb burned out.

135
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:40,400
And you're trying to say as
much as you can about the

136
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,820
value of X.

137
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:44,890
You know that X, the time of
the burn out of the first

138
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:49,560
bulb, was sometime before Z. But
you do not to know where

139
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:52,760
exactly in that interval
it's going to be.

140
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,590
So what we want to calculate is
a probability distribution

141
00:07:56,590 --> 00:08:00,310
for X, which is going to be a
probability distribution on

142
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:02,360
this interval.

143
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,830
So let us now calculate.

144
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:07,720
In this example, we're
assuming that X is

145
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,790
exponential.

146
00:08:08,790 --> 00:08:14,570
So the density of X takes this
form for x non-negative.

147
00:08:14,570 --> 00:08:18,390
We're also told that Y is
exponential, with the same

148
00:08:18,390 --> 00:08:19,500
distribution.

149
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:24,300
So we have the same expression
for the density of Y.

150
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:32,090
And now, we can fix some
z non-negative.

151
00:08:32,090 --> 00:08:34,539
Only non-negative z's
are possible.

152
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:37,970
So we will try to calculate this
conditional PDF only for

153
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:39,570
non-negative z's.

154
00:08:39,570 --> 00:08:46,800
And using the form of the Bayes
rule that we have, what

155
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:50,520
we got is, let's first put down
the denominator term.

156
00:08:50,520 --> 00:08:54,820

157
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,810
And here we have lambda e
to the minus lambda x.

158
00:08:59,810 --> 00:09:04,720
And this is valid when
x is non-negative.

159
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,470
And then we multiply with this
conditional density, which is

160
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:13,560
a conditional density of Y,
evaluated at z minus x.

161
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:16,000
And this is going to be
lambda e to the mines

162
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,890
lambda z minus x.

163
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,710
And this expression here is
valid when the density of Y

164
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,080
takes this form when the
argument is non-negative.

165
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,730
So it takes this form when the
argument is non-negative.

166
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:34,090
The e argument is z minus x.

167
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,810
So this is valid when z minus
x is non-negative.

168
00:09:38,810 --> 00:09:42,810
Or what is the same, it's valid
when x is less than or

169
00:09:42,810 --> 00:09:44,130
equal to z.

170
00:09:44,130 --> 00:09:47,950
So in this range, when x is
non-negative and x is less

171
00:09:47,950 --> 00:09:51,360
than or equal to z, we
have this expression.

172
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,440
Now, we notice that we have a
term, e to the minus lambda x

173
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,510
here, and we have a similar term
here but with an extra

174
00:09:57,510 --> 00:09:58,580
minus sign.

175
00:09:58,580 --> 00:10:01,250
So these two terms will
cancel each other.

176
00:10:01,250 --> 00:10:05,215
And what we're left with is
the following expression.

177
00:10:05,215 --> 00:10:11,290

178
00:10:11,290 --> 00:10:15,980
And this expression is valid
given the constraints that we

179
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:18,810
have imposed so far. z
is non-negative, x is

180
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:22,420
non-negative, and x is less
than or equal to z.

181
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:27,370
So it is valid when x and
z obey this condition.

182
00:10:27,370 --> 00:10:31,920
And this is the form for the
conditional PDF of X if I tell

183
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:37,590
you the value of Z. This is
the form that it takes.

184
00:10:37,590 --> 00:10:40,260
What's special about this PDF?

185
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:43,540
Remember that we have fixed
Z to a certain value.

186
00:10:43,540 --> 00:10:46,160
And we're trying to describe
the likelihood of the

187
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,200
different values of
X. But there is no

188
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,180
dependence on x here.

189
00:10:52,180 --> 00:10:57,120
So the PDF is constant
as a function of x.

190
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,580
And this means that if I tell
you the value of Z, then X is

191
00:11:01,580 --> 00:11:05,820
going to have a uniform
conditional distribution on

192
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:07,070
this interval.

193
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:13,440

194
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,480
And this is quite interesting.

195
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:18,370

196
00:11:18,370 --> 00:11:20,870
Essentially it tells
you the following.

197
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:23,820
Going back to our light bulb
example, if I tell you that

198
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:28,190
the second light bulb burned
out at this time, and I ask

199
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:32,220
you, when do you think the first
light bulb burned out,

200
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:35,450
you're going to tell me, I
really don't know, I have

201
00:11:35,450 --> 00:11:37,250
complete ignorance.

202
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:43,330
Any time in this interval is,
in some sense, as likely as

203
00:11:43,330 --> 00:11:44,580
any other time.

204
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:47,200

205
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,100
Now, this conclusion might seem
perhaps surprising or

206
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,310
unexpected.

207
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:57,570
But it becomes quite plausible
if you start thinking in terms

208
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:01,250
of coin tosses and the geometric
distribution.

209
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:05,850
To make a discrete time
analagous story, we could

210
00:12:05,850 --> 00:12:07,460
think as follows.

211
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:10,310
We have here time that
is divided in slots.

212
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:14,500
And you keep tossing a coin
until heads is obtained for

213
00:12:14,500 --> 00:12:15,550
the first time.

214
00:12:15,550 --> 00:12:17,950
And this is a geometric
random variable.

215
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,600
Then you keep tossing again
until heads is obtained for

216
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:23,970
the second time.

217
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,020
So this Y is also going to be
a geometric random variable.

218
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:33,160
If I tell you that the second
heads showed up at this time

219
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:36,370
and I ask you, what do you think
about the first heads,

220
00:12:36,370 --> 00:12:39,800
well, you're going to tell me,
I know that there was exactly

221
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:43,180
one head in the time
up to here.

222
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:45,780
But all slots are
equally likely.

223
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:50,390
The one head that we have may
have appeared in any one of

224
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:51,980
those previous slots.

225
00:12:51,980 --> 00:12:55,380
And each one of those previous
slots has the same probability
