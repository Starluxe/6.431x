1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,310

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:04,450
In this problem, we're going
to look at the probability

3
00:00:04,450 --> 00:00:07,630
that when you take a stick and
break it into three pieces

4
00:00:07,630 --> 00:00:10,850
randomly, that these three
pieces can actually be used to

5
00:00:10,850 --> 00:00:13,420
form a triangle.

6
00:00:13,420 --> 00:00:20,230
So we start out with a stick of
unit length-- so length 1.

7
00:00:20,230 --> 00:00:26,130
And we'll choose a point along
the stick to break.

8
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,090
And we'll choose that point
uniformly at random.

9
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:31,470
So let's say that we
chose it here.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,030
That was a point where
we'll break it.

11
00:00:34,030 --> 00:00:37,720
And then independently of this
first choice, we'll again

12
00:00:37,720 --> 00:00:42,390
choose a second point to break
it, again uniformly at random,

13
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:43,550
along the entire stick.

14
00:00:43,550 --> 00:00:48,410
So let's say the second point
we chose is here.

15
00:00:48,410 --> 00:00:50,880
So what we have now is, we'll
break it here and here.

16
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,160
And so we'll have
three pieces--

17
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:53,960
the first one, the left
one, the middle one,

18
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:54,860
and the right one.

19
00:00:54,860 --> 00:00:57,280
And we want to know, what's the
probability that when you

20
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:01,360
take these three pieces you
can form a triangle?

21
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:02,650
So the first thing we
should ask ourselves

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:04,739
is, what do you need?

23
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:07,590
What conditions must be
satisfied in order to actually

24
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:10,330
be able to form a triangle
with three pieces?

25
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:13,620
So you could think about what
would stop you from being able

26
00:01:13,620 --> 00:01:14,660
to do that?

27
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:18,670
Well, one possibility is
that you have pieces

28
00:01:18,670 --> 00:01:19,920
that look like this.

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,540

30
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:28,450
So in that case, you would
try to form something

31
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:33,080
that looks like this.

32
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:36,340
But you can't get a triangle,
because these two pieces are

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:38,430
too short, and they can't
touch each other.

34
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:42,590
So actually, the condition that
must be satisfied is that

35
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:48,230
when you take any two of the
three pieces, their combined

36
00:01:48,230 --> 00:01:51,870
length has to be greater than
the length of the remaining

37
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,740
third piece.

38
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:54,450
And that's true for
any two pieces.

39
00:01:54,450 --> 00:01:57,040

40
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,320
And really, that's just so that
any two pieces, they can

41
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:05,510
touch and still form
a triangle.

42
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:09,400
So let's try to add some
probability to this.

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,990
So we have a unit-length
stick.

44
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:18,470
So let's actually give
a coordinate system.

45
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,980
The stick goes from 0 to 1.

46
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,790
And let's say that we break
it at these two points.

47
00:02:23,790 --> 00:02:32,280

48
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,810
The first point where we choose,
we'll call that X. So

49
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,620
that's the first point that
we choose to break it.

50
00:02:41,620 --> 00:02:45,230
And then the second point we
choose, we'll call that Y.

51
00:02:45,230 --> 00:02:51,260
Now, note that I've drawn it so
that X is to the left of Y.

52
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,300
But it could actually be the
case that the first point I

53
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:56,460
chose is here and the
second point that I

54
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,230
chose is to the left.

55
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:07,340
But for now, let's first assume
that's this scenario

56
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:10,480
holds, that the first
point is to the left

57
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,390
of the second point.

58
00:03:13,390 --> 00:03:20,320
So under this assumption,
we can see that from the

59
00:03:20,320 --> 00:03:22,490
definition of these random
variables, we can actually see

60
00:03:22,490 --> 00:03:26,860
that the lengths are given
by these three lengths.

61
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:30,150

62
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:36,760
So the lengths are X. The
left-most piece has length X.

63
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,610
The second, middle, piece has
length of Y minus X. And the

64
00:03:42,610 --> 00:03:51,420
last piece has length 1 minus
Y. And now, let's recall our

65
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:54,820
three conditions.

66
00:03:54,820 --> 00:03:59,960
So the conditions were that any
two of these, the sum of

67
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:03,770
any two lengths has to be
greater than the length of the

68
00:04:03,770 --> 00:04:05,380
third piece.

69
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:08,320
So let's do these together.

70
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:16,120
So X plus Y minus X has to be
greater than y minus 1.

71
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:21,860
So with these two pieces, you
can cover this third piece.

72
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:28,990
We also need that with the first
and third pieces, we can

73
00:04:28,990 --> 00:04:32,460
cover the middle piece.

74
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:42,110
And we need with the second and
third pieces, we can cover

75
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:44,410
the first piece.

76
00:04:44,410 --> 00:04:46,690
Now, this looks kind of messy,
but in fact, we can actually

77
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:48,810
simplify this.

78
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,050
So this actually simplifies.

79
00:04:51,050 --> 00:04:53,330
X minus X-- that disappears.

80
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,110
And so this actually simplifies
to 2Y has

81
00:04:58,110 --> 00:04:59,070
to be at least 1.

82
00:04:59,070 --> 00:05:03,187
Or, even more simply, y has
to be greater than 1/2.

83
00:05:03,187 --> 00:05:06,050

84
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:08,050
What about this one?

85
00:05:08,050 --> 00:05:11,255
This one we can rearrange
things again.

86
00:05:11,255 --> 00:05:14,430
The X we can move over here,
Y we can move over here.

87
00:05:14,430 --> 00:05:19,220
And we get that 2X plus 1 has
to be greater than 2Y.

88
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:29,680
Or put in other words, Y is
less than X plus 1/2.

89
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:32,970
And for the last one, again,
we can simplify.

90
00:05:32,970 --> 00:05:34,570
The Y's cancel each other out.

91
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,400
And we're left with
2X is less than 1.

92
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:40,140

93
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,390
Or X is less than 1/2.

94
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:45,390

95
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:48,980
So these are our three
conditions

96
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,920
that need to be satisfied.

97
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:53,180
So now, we just have to figure
out what's the probability

98
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:55,720
that this is actually
satisfied.

99
00:05:55,720 --> 00:06:06,580
Now, let's go back to original
definition and see what are

100
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:08,840
the actual distributions for
these random variables, X and

101
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:09,200
Y.

102
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:12,920
Remember, we defined them to
be X is the location of the

103
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:16,940
first break and Y is the
location of the second break.

104
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:20,640
And as we said in the problem,
these are chosen uniformly at

105
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:23,560
random, and they're
independent.

106
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:29,290
And so we can actually draw
out their joint PDF.

107
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:35,280
So X and Y, it can cover any
point in the square.

108
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:42,750
And moreover, it's actually
uniform within this square,

109
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:46,450
because each one is chosen
uniformly at random.

110
00:06:46,450 --> 00:06:48,380
And they're independent.

111
00:06:48,380 --> 00:06:51,780
So it's anywhere in here.

112
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:54,320
And so what do we need to do?

113
00:06:54,320 --> 00:06:56,840
We just need to identify what's
the probability that

114
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,230
these three conditions hold.

115
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:00,480
Let me adjust.

116
00:07:00,480 --> 00:07:04,340

117
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:09,150
Let me write this,
line these up.

118
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:14,520
So these are our three
conditions that we need.

119
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:16,790
And now, remember, we're still
working under the assumption

120
00:07:16,790 --> 00:07:20,450
that the first point that we
chose is actually to the left

121
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:22,210
of the second point.

122
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:24,990
So what does that mean?

123
00:07:24,990 --> 00:07:28,470
That means that we are
actually in this top

124
00:07:28,470 --> 00:07:30,640
triangle, top 1/2.

125
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:35,520
X is less than Y. So
what do we need?

126
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,830
We need Y to be at least 1/2.

127
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,460
So here's 1/2.

128
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:42,530
So we need Y to be
above this line.

129
00:07:42,530 --> 00:07:45,030
We need X to be less than
1/2, so we need X to

130
00:07:45,030 --> 00:07:48,890
be to the left here.

131
00:07:48,890 --> 00:07:52,180
So far, we're stuck in
this upper square.

132
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:56,970
And the last thing we need is Y
to be less than X plus 1/2.

133
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:02,870
The line Y equals X plus
1/2 is this one.

134
00:08:02,870 --> 00:08:07,430
So Y has to be less than that,
so we have to be in this

135
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:08,910
triangle here.

136
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,210
So these three conditions tell
us that in order for us to

137
00:08:12,210 --> 00:08:18,110
have a triangle, we need for X
and Y to fall jointly in this

138
00:08:18,110 --> 00:08:20,040
small triangle here.

139
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,730
And now, because the joint
distribution is uniform, we

140
00:08:24,730 --> 00:08:28,620
know that the density is just
1, because the area

141
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:30,700
here is just 1.

142
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,150
So the height is
just 1 as well.

143
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:37,360
And so the density or the
probability of falling within

144
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,559
this smallest triangle is just
going to be also the area of

145
00:08:41,559 --> 00:08:42,390
this triangle.

146
00:08:42,390 --> 00:08:45,440
And what is the area
of this triangle?

147
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,410
Well, you can fit eight of
these triangles in here.

148
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:51,130
Or you could think of it as
1/2 times 1/2 times 1/2.

149
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,920
So the area is just 1/8.

150
00:08:54,920 --> 00:09:01,360
So assuming that X is less than
Y, then the probability

151
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:05,450
forming a triangle is 1/8.

152
00:09:05,450 --> 00:09:08,790
Now, that's only half the story,
because it's possible

153
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:13,220
that when you chose these two
break points, that we actually

154
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:20,830
had the opposite result, that
X, the point that you chose

155
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:23,580
first falls to the right of
the point that you chose

156
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:28,670
second, in which case everything
kind of flips.

157
00:09:28,670 --> 00:09:34,580
Now, we assume that Y is less
than X, which means that now

158
00:09:34,580 --> 00:09:39,310
we're in this lower triangle
in the square.

159
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:41,680
Now, we could go through this
whole exercise again.

160
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,110
But really, what we can see is
that all we've really done is

161
00:09:45,110 --> 00:09:48,320
just swap the names.

162
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:48,550
instead.

163
00:09:48,550 --> 00:09:53,530
Of having X and Y, we now
call X, we call it XY.

164
00:09:53,530 --> 00:09:55,870
We call Y X.

165
00:09:55,870 --> 00:10:00,480
And so if we just swap names,
we can see that--

166
00:10:00,480 --> 00:10:02,420
let's just fast forward through
all these steps and

167
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:05,220
see that we could just swap
names here too as well in the

168
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:05,760
three conditions.

169
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,810
So instead of needing Y to be
greater than 1/2, we just need

170
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:11,440
X to be greater than 1/2.

171
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:14,230
And instead of having
X less than 1/2, we

172
00:10:14,230 --> 00:10:15,760
need Y less than 1/2.

173
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:18,770
And then we also swap this.

174
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:22,790
So we need X to be less
than Y plus 1/2.

175
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,030
Or Y is greater than
X minus 1/2.

176
00:10:27,030 --> 00:10:29,800

177
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:33,680
Now, let's figure out what
this corresponds to.

178
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,020
We need X to be greater
than 1/2.

179
00:10:36,020 --> 00:10:38,370
So it needs to be to
the right of here.

180
00:10:38,370 --> 00:10:39,920
We need Y to be less than 1/2.

181
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,380
So we need it to be
below this line.

182
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:47,300
And we need Y to be greater
than X minus 1/2.

183
00:10:47,300 --> 00:10:51,120
What is the line Y equals
X minus 1/2?

184
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:54,260
That is this line here.

185
00:10:54,260 --> 00:10:55,920
And we need Y to be
greater than that.

186
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:58,060
So it needs to be
above this line.

187
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:03,470
And so we get that this is the
triangle, the small triangle

188
00:11:03,470 --> 00:11:05,820
that we need in this case.

189
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,020
Notice that it's exactly the
same area as this one.

190
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:13,870
And so we get another
contribution of 1/8 here.

191
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:20,030
So the final answer is,
1/8 plus 1/8 is 1/4.

192
00:11:20,030 --> 00:11:23,970
So the probability of forming
a triangle using this three

193
00:11:23,970 --> 00:11:26,860
pieces is exactly 1/4.

194
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:31,620
And so notice that what we've
done is, you've set things up

195
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:34,360
very methodically in the
beginning by assigning these

196
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:35,090
random variables.

197
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,090
You consider different cases.

198
00:11:38,090 --> 00:11:41,530
Because you don't actually know
the order in which X and

199
00:11:41,530 --> 00:11:45,950
Y fall, let's just assume that
one particular order and work

200
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:46,740
from there .

201
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:49,100
And then do the other
case as well.

202
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:53,320
And it just so happened that
because of the symmetry of the

203
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,120
problem, the second case was
actually very simple.

204
00:11:56,120 --> 00:11:58,870
We could just see that it
is actually symmetric.

205
00:11:58,870 --> 00:12:01,720
And so we get the same answer.

206
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:04,470
So this is kind of an
interesting problem because

207
00:12:04,470 --> 00:12:07,110
it's actually a practical
application of something that

208
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,090
you might actually do.

209
00:12:08,090 --> 00:12:12,000
And you can see that just by
applying these probability

210
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,310
concepts, you can actually
calculate an interesting

211
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:15,470
probability.

212
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,350
And the answer to this
question is 1/4.

213
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:20,720
So I hope that was interesting,
and we'll

214
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,970
see you next time.

215
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:22,610
