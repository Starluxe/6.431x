1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,846

2
00:00:00,846 --> 00:00:01,270
Hi.

3
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:03,660
In this problem, we're going to
get more practice working

4
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:07,700
with densities and also working
with conditional

5
00:00:07,700 --> 00:00:11,230
densities by conditioning
on an event.

6
00:00:11,230 --> 00:00:14,410
The density that we're given is
one for a random variable

7
00:00:14,410 --> 00:00:19,400
X. And we're told that the
density is x over 4 when x is

8
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,470
between 1 and 3.

9
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:22,720
And otherwise, it's
equal to zero.

10
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:25,420
So here, I've drawn
out this density.

11
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:29,950
From 1 to 3, it's x over 4.

12
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:33,040
So it goes from 1/4 to
3/4, and outside

13
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,890
of that, it's zero.

14
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,350
And we're also given a
definition for an event, A,

15
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:39,830
which is the event that
this random variable

16
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:41,530
X is at least 2.

17
00:00:41,530 --> 00:00:45,565
So think of it as here is
the line where it's 2.

18
00:00:45,565 --> 00:00:49,770
A is the event that the random
variable is greater than or

19
00:00:49,770 --> 00:00:51,740
equal to 2.

20
00:00:51,740 --> 00:00:55,000
And now, in part (a),
we're asked to

21
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,820
find a bunch of things.

22
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:02,390
The first one is the expected
value of X. The expected

23
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:06,680
value, remember, the definition
is this integral.

24
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:15,410
You integrate x times
the density of X.

25
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,520
And the important thing here to
remember is that when you

26
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:24,450
plug this in, when you plug in
the density, which is x over

27
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,560
4, you need to remember
to correct the limits.

28
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:34,120
Because this density is only
valid from x from 1 to 3.

29
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:37,300
So instead of integrating from
minus infinity to infinity, we

30
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,850
only go from 1 to 3, because
outside of that range, this

31
00:01:39,850 --> 00:01:43,930
integral is actually zero
because the density is zero.

32
00:01:43,930 --> 00:01:49,530
So now it's just solving this
integral, which is x squared

33
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:52,880
over 4 from 1 to 3.

34
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:55,250
So what exactly is that?

35
00:01:55,250 --> 00:01:58,580
That's going to give you 1/4.

36
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,670
And you integrate x squared.

37
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:07,700
That's 1/3 x cubed
from 1 to 3.

38
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:17,710
So that's 1/12 times 27 minus 1,
which gives you 26 over 12,

39
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:20,575
which you can also further
simplify, 13/6.

40
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,100

41
00:02:23,100 --> 00:02:25,990
So that is our first answer.

42
00:02:25,990 --> 00:02:29,820
And actually let's just check
that this kind of makes sense.

43
00:02:29,820 --> 00:02:35,000
This is a little bit over 2,
so it's somewhere here.

44
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,460
And yes, that makes sense.

45
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:39,510
Because it makes sense
it's a little past 2.

46
00:02:39,510 --> 00:02:42,290
If this were flat, if this were
uniform, then we know

47
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,370
that the expectation would
be exactly the

48
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:45,440
midpoint, which is at 2.

49
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,540
But it's actually skewed more
towards higher values of x.

50
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,010
So you would expect that the
expectation is actually to the

51
00:02:54,010 --> 00:02:56,590
right of 2, a little
bit higher than 2.

52
00:02:56,590 --> 00:02:59,590
So that seems to check out.

53
00:02:59,590 --> 00:03:03,120
The next thing to calculate is
the probability of this event,

54
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,040
the probability of the event A,
which we could also write

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,120
as the probability that this
random variable is at least 2.

56
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:11,832

57
00:03:11,832 --> 00:03:14,530
Now how do you calculate the
probability the random

58
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:15,960
variable is at least 2?

59
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:23,190
It's just a matter of
integrating the density.

60
00:03:23,190 --> 00:03:27,470
And you integrate the density
starting from 2, because you

61
00:03:27,470 --> 00:03:28,450
want it to be at least 2.

62
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,250
And you integrate it
all the way up.

63
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:32,270
In general, it would
be to infinity.

64
00:03:32,270 --> 00:03:37,070
But we know that for values
of x greater than 3,

65
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,360
the density is 0.

66
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,260
So we actually just integrate
from 2 to 3.

67
00:03:42,260 --> 00:03:43,400
Really, what we're doing
is we're just

68
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:45,640
calculating this part.

69
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,440

70
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:52,240
So we can just again plug
in what this is.

71
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:55,270
It's anywhere from 2 to
3 of the density.

72
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,990
In this range, this form will
hold, so it's x over 4.

73
00:03:58,990 --> 00:04:02,070

74
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:13,840
And now that's going to give you
1/8 x squared from 2 to 3.

75
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:19,550
So it's 1/8 times 8.

76
00:04:19,550 --> 00:04:29,800
Sorry, times 9 minus 4, which
gives you 5/8 as your answer.

77
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:32,770
And again, we can check that
this kind of makes sense.

78
00:04:32,770 --> 00:04:36,710
The probability that the random
variable is at least 2

79
00:04:36,710 --> 00:04:40,290
is 5/8, which is a little
bit more than half.

80
00:04:40,290 --> 00:04:41,780
And again, we can compare
this to the case

81
00:04:41,780 --> 00:04:43,060
where it would be uniform.

82
00:04:43,060 --> 00:04:46,170
If it were uniform and flat,
then the probability that it's

83
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,590
greater than 2 would
be exactly half.

84
00:04:48,590 --> 00:04:49,620
Because it's symmetric.

85
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:52,800
It's half on this side,
half on this side.

86
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:55,860
But because it's skewed, again,
more towards larger

87
00:04:55,860 --> 00:04:58,620
values, you would expect the
probability that it's at least

88
00:04:58,620 --> 00:05:00,600
2 to be a little bit
more than a half.

89
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:04,150
And the probably that it's less
than 2 would be a little

90
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:05,990
less than a half.

91
00:05:05,990 --> 00:05:08,570
So that also checks out.

92
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:13,890
Now let's actually calculate the
next thing, which is the

93
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,290
conditional density of X given
the event A. So what does it

94
00:05:19,290 --> 00:05:20,350
really mean?

95
00:05:20,350 --> 00:05:24,550
It means now by conditioning on
A, we're saying that we're

96
00:05:24,550 --> 00:05:27,300
in the universe where the
random variable is

97
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:28,800
actually at least 2.

98
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,140
So instead of focusing on the
original density, now we're

99
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:34,550
actually just in this
restricted universe

100
00:05:34,550 --> 00:05:36,350
of just this part.

101
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:39,300

102
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:43,560
And now we want an updated
density for only this part.

103
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,360
And in general, what really
happens is you just take the

104
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:52,960
original density that held for
the entire random variable and

105
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:53,950
rescale it.

106
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:56,220
Because if you just
took this, it

107
00:05:56,220 --> 00:05:57,380
wouldn't be a valid density.

108
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:00,150
Because we know that this
thing, this part of the

109
00:06:00,150 --> 00:06:02,630
density, only integrates
to 5/8.

110
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:04,430
And you need a density
to integrate to 1.

111
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:05,460
So what do we do?

112
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,810
We take the original density and
rescale it so that it does

113
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:10,700
integrate to 1.

114
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:13,610
And what that amounts to is
really just taking the

115
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:22,180
original density and dividing
it by the probability of A,

116
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:23,910
which is the probability of
this portion of this.

117
00:06:23,910 --> 00:06:28,120
And you see that that exactly is
the normalizing factor that

118
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,720
we need in order for this
to integrate to 1.

119
00:06:31,720 --> 00:06:36,050
And again, we need to be a
little bit careful, because

120
00:06:36,050 --> 00:06:45,550
this is only true when x is
within A, in other words, when

121
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:50,210
x is between 2 and 3.

122
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:52,925
And otherwise, it
would be zero.

123
00:06:52,925 --> 00:06:58,140

124
00:06:58,140 --> 00:07:01,240
Now we know what these
things are.

125
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,720
The original density is x
over four, and that was

126
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,640
valid from 1 to 3.

127
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:09,750
And we're in 2 to 3, so
that's still valid.

128
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:11,210
So it's x over four.

129
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:17,930
And then the probability of A we
calculated earlier is 5/8.

130
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:21,260
So when we divide that
by that, we get 8/5.

131
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:24,970
And so when you simplify this,
you get 2x over five.

132
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:33,020

133
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:38,760
And that becomes your
new density.

134
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:43,620
And we could actually also
plot out what this is.

135
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,140
And it would actually look
something like this.

136
00:07:45,140 --> 00:07:49,480

137
00:07:49,480 --> 00:07:54,290
It would be this portion
of the density.

138
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:01,910
So notice that 2/5 is the
slope as opposed to 1/4.

139
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:04,470
And really what we've done is
we've taken this and rescaled

140
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:07,990
it so that this trapezoid now
integrates actually to 1,

141
00:08:07,990 --> 00:08:10,200
whereas this portion
of it would only

142
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:11,450
integrate it to 5/8.

143
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:15,810

144
00:08:15,810 --> 00:08:21,270
Now for the last part of this
part (a), we're asked to find

145
00:08:21,270 --> 00:08:24,090
a conditional expectation.

146
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:27,810
So conditioned on the event A,
what is the expectation of X?

147
00:08:27,810 --> 00:08:32,669
Or put in other words, what is
the expectation of X given

148
00:08:32,669 --> 00:08:36,130
that we know that
it's at least 2.

149
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,630
Well we know that when we
calculate expectations, the

150
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:41,620
general form is something like
this kind of integral.

151
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:45,520
But because we're conditioning
on A, we have to change the

152
00:08:45,520 --> 00:08:49,100
density to the conditional
density.

153
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:54,250
So we integrate as before, x.

154
00:08:54,250 --> 00:08:56,060
And we use the conditional
density,

155
00:08:56,060 --> 00:09:00,720
which is 2x over five.

156
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,970
And now, we need to be careful,
because again, the

157
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:08,430
limits in general are minus
infinity to infinity.

158
00:09:08,430 --> 00:09:12,650
But we need to write the right
ones, the ones that are valid

159
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,800
for this expression for the
conditional density.

160
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:19,650
So 2x over 5 is only
valid from 2 to 3.

161
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:24,380
So we integrate actually
from 2 to 3.

162
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:27,530
So what is this integral?

163
00:09:27,530 --> 00:09:33,870
It's 2/5 times the integral
of 2 to 3 of x squared.

164
00:09:33,870 --> 00:09:41,390
So it's 2/5 integral 1/3
x cubed from 2 to 3.

165
00:09:41,390 --> 00:09:44,210

166
00:09:44,210 --> 00:09:54,900
So it's going to give you
2/15 of 27 minus 8.

167
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:58,000
So the final answer
that you get--

168
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,940
this gives you 19 times
2 is 38 over 15.

169
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:07,130

170
00:10:07,130 --> 00:10:13,070
And you can see that if
you look at this.

171
00:10:13,070 --> 00:10:19,860
This is 2 and 8/15, which
is a little bit

172
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,810
more than 2 and 1/2.

173
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:28,200
And again, if we're in the
conditional world where x is

174
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:31,330
least 2 or effectively where
x is between 2 and 3.

175
00:10:31,330 --> 00:10:33,760
And if, in this conditional
world, the distribution were

176
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,320
again uniform, you would
expect this conditional

177
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:40,600
expectation to be 2 and 1/2
exactly, the midpoint.

178
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:43,850
But because, just like before in
the unconditional world, in

179
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:47,210
the condition world, we still
had the case that it's skewed

180
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,540
more towards 3.

181
00:10:48,540 --> 00:10:50,340
So because of that,
it's a little bit

182
00:10:50,340 --> 00:10:51,450
more than 2 and 1/2.

183
00:10:51,450 --> 00:10:57,060
So it's actually 38/15, which
you can again just do a quick

184
00:10:57,060 --> 00:10:58,860
sanity check to make sure that
our answer makes sense.

185
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,110

186
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:07,620
Now one last part, part (b).

187
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:15,720
Now introduced a new random
variable Y. And we define it

188
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,240
as Y equal to X squared.

189
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:21,440

190
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:27,480
And we are asked to calculate
some things.

191
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:33,880
So first, let's calculate the
expected value of Y. Well, to

192
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:36,897
use the standard way, we would
have to calculate the pdf of

193
00:11:36,897 --> 00:11:40,090
Y, and then use the
integral formula.

194
00:11:40,090 --> 00:11:42,740
But in order to do that, we
would need the pdf of Y, but

195
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,550
we don't actually know
what that is.

196
00:11:44,550 --> 00:11:51,050
But because Y is related to X,
we can actually just write it

197
00:11:51,050 --> 00:11:53,690
in terms of expected
value of X squared

198
00:11:53,690 --> 00:11:55,450
because Y is X squared.

199
00:11:55,450 --> 00:11:58,050
And now, we use a formula.

200
00:11:58,050 --> 00:12:02,100
The expectation of a function
of a random variable is the

201
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:02,590
same thing.

202
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:07,030
And so instead of writing just
X, we write the function of X.

203
00:12:07,030 --> 00:12:15,530
So it's x squared times the
density of X. So that's the

204
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,660
general form.

205
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:19,070
And now let's actually
plug it in and see

206
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,960
what it actually is.

207
00:12:19,960 --> 00:12:21,570
The density--

208
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:24,190
we go back to the original
case-- is x over 4.

209
00:12:24,190 --> 00:12:28,420
So we get x cubed over 4.

210
00:12:28,420 --> 00:12:31,850
And now also we need to
update the limits.

211
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,330
This density is only
valid from 1 to 3.

212
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:36,700
So we have to integrate
from 1 to 3.

213
00:12:36,700 --> 00:12:39,330

214
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:42,880
So when we do this integral,
what do we get?

215
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:52,560
Well, we get x to the fourth
over 16 from 1 to 3, which

216
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:55,240
gives you 1/16.

217
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:58,670
And then you get 81--

218
00:12:58,670 --> 00:12:59,840
3 to the fourth is 81--

219
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:00,700
minus 1.

220
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,030
So 80 over 16 is exactly 5.

221
00:13:06,030 --> 00:13:10,070

222
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:14,330
So even though we don't know
exactly what the distribution

223
00:13:14,330 --> 00:13:18,520
for Y is, we can use what we
know about X to calculate the

224
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:25,060
expectation of Y. Now the second
part is we want to find

225
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:33,330
the variance of Y. And again,
the usual formula is

226
00:13:33,330 --> 00:13:36,290
expectation of Y squared
minus expectation

227
00:13:36,290 --> 00:13:40,460
of Y quantity squared.

228
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,550
Now we already know
what this is.

229
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:44,180
Expectation of Y, we just
calculated, is 5.

230
00:13:44,180 --> 00:13:46,130
But we also need to know
what the expectation

231
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:48,030
of Y squared is.

232
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:54,910
And we can use the same method
here, because Y squared is

233
00:13:54,910 --> 00:13:57,070
just X to the fourth.

234
00:13:57,070 --> 00:13:59,840
So expectation of Y
squared is just

235
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:04,030
expectation of X to the fourth.

236
00:14:04,030 --> 00:14:06,390
And now we can use the exact
same sort of formula to

237
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,720
calculate what that is.

238
00:14:07,720 --> 00:14:14,470
So we integrate x to the fourth
times the density of X.

239
00:14:14,470 --> 00:14:15,730
We plug that in.

240
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:18,150
The density of X is x over
4, so this becomes x to

241
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:20,520
the fifth over 4.

242
00:14:20,520 --> 00:14:24,350
And then, again, the limits we
need to be careful of goes

243
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:26,910
from 1 to 3.

244
00:14:26,910 --> 00:14:30,280
So when we do have this
integral, we get x to the

245
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:48,460
sixth over 24 from 1 to 3,
which equals 91 over 3.

246
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:51,760
So the last part now is just
combining the pieces.

247
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,050
The variance of Y now is just
expectation of Y squared,

248
00:14:55,050 --> 00:14:59,340
which is 91 over 3 minus
expectation of Y quantity

249
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:03,200
squared, which is 5
squared, is 25.

250
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:07,290
And that gives you 16 over
3 as your final answer.

251
00:15:07,290 --> 00:15:11,310

252
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:15,550
So this problem really was kind
of a drill problem that

253
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:19,560
started out with giving you
a density and asked you to

254
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:23,480
calculate a variety of different
quantities related

255
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,490
to that density.

256
00:15:24,490 --> 00:15:27,340
And then we also added another
wrinkle to a by conditioning

257
00:15:27,340 --> 00:15:31,640
on an event and working with
a conditional density.

258
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:35,300
The last thing was coming up
with a related random variable

259
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:38,330
and using the original random
variable to help you calculate

260
00:15:38,330 --> 00:15:41,210
quantities related to that
new random variable.

261
00:15:41,210 --> 00:15:42,570
So we'll see you next time.

262
00:15:42,570 --> 00:15:44,867
