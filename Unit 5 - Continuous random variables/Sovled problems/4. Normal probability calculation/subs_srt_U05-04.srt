00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,490

2
00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:01,360
Hi.

3
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,990
In this video, we're going to
do standard probability

4
00:00:03,990 --> 00:00:07,640
calculations for normal
random variables.

5
00:00:07,640 --> 00:00:10,670
We're given that X is standard
normal with mean 0 and

6
00:00:10,670 --> 00:00:11,730
variance 1.

7
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,420
And Y is normal with mean
one and variance 4.

8
00:00:15,420 --> 00:00:18,310
And we're asked for a couple
of probabilities.

9
00:00:18,310 --> 00:00:22,400
For the normal CDF, we don't
have a closed form expression.

10
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,610
And so people generally tabulate
values and for the

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,570
standard normal case.

12
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:34,880
So if we want little X equal to
3.49, we just look for 3.4

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,970
along the rows and 0.09 along
the columns, and then pick the

14
00:00:37,970 --> 00:00:39,720
value appropriately.

15
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:43,680
So for part (a), we're asked
what's the probability that X

16
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:46,230
is less than equal to 1.5?

17
00:00:46,230 --> 00:00:50,110
That's exactly phi of 1.5
and we can look that up.

18
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:56,950
1.5 directly and
that's 0.9332.

19
00:00:56,950 --> 00:00:59,260
Then we asked, what's the
probability that X is less

20
00:00:59,260 --> 00:01:02,250
than equal to negative 1?

21
00:01:02,250 --> 00:01:05,610
Notice that negative values
are not on this table.

22
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,800
And the reason that is is
because the standard normal is

23
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:11,140
symmetric around zero.

24
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,780
And we don't really need that.

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:15,490
We just recognize that the area
in this region is exactly

26
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:17,490
the area in this region.

27
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:20,320
And so that's equal to the
probability that X is greater

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,920
than equal to 1.

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,940
This is equal to 1 minus
the probability that X

30
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:27,920
is less than 1.

31
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,350
And we can put the equal sign
in here because X is

32
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:33,370
continuous, it doesn't matter.

33
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:35,570
And so we're going to get,
this is equal to 1

34
00:01:35,570 --> 00:01:38,020
minus phi of one.

35
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:40,310
And we can look up phi
of 1, which is

36
00:01:40,310 --> 00:01:49,650
1.00, and that's 0.8413.

37
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:51,330
OK.

38
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:56,050
For part (b), we're asked for
the distribution of Y

39
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,160
minus 1 over 2.

40
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:00,650
So any linear function
of a normal random

41
00:02:00,650 --> 00:02:02,860
variable is also normal.

42
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:06,930
And you can see that by using
the derived distribution for

43
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,800
linear functions of
random variables.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:15,360
So in this case, we only need to
figure out what's the mean

45
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,620
and the variance of this
normal random variable.

46
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:22,880
So the mean in this case, I'm
going to write that as Y over

47
00:02:22,880 --> 00:02:24,130
2 minus 1/2.

48
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:27,020

49
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,970
The expectation operator
is linear and so

50
00:02:28,970 --> 00:02:30,220
that's going to be--

51
00:02:30,220 --> 00:02:34,990

52
00:02:34,990 --> 00:02:38,810
and the expectation in
this case is 1, so

53
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:41,310
that's going to be 0.

54
00:02:41,310 --> 00:02:42,560
Now the variance.

55
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,840

56
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:49,320
For the shift, it doesn't
affect the spread.

57
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,530
And so the variance is exactly
going to be the same without

58
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:55,300
the minus 1/2.

59
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,240
And for the constant, you
can just pull that

60
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,490
out and square it.

61
00:02:58,490 --> 00:03:01,530

62
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:04,410
And the variance of
Y we know is 4.

63
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,670
And so that's 1/4 times
4, that's 1.

64
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,170
OK.

65
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:11,190
So now we know that Y
minus 1 over 2 is

66
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:12,700
actually standard normal.

67
00:03:12,700 --> 00:03:16,740

68
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:21,840
Actually for any normal random
variable, you can follow the

69
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:22,500
same procedure.

70
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,960
You just subtract its mean,
which is 1 in this case.

71
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:28,050
And divide by its standard
deviation and you will get a

72
00:03:28,050 --> 00:03:31,520
standard normal distribution.

73
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:37,560
All right, so for part (c) we
want the probability that Y is

74
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,190
between negative 1 and 1.

75
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:45,420
So let's try to massage it so
that we can use the standard

76
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,980
normal table.

77
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:49,430
And we already know that this
is standard normal, so let's

78
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:53,210
subtract both sides
by negative 1.

79
00:03:53,210 --> 00:04:04,240

80
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,170
And that's equal to--

81
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:10,120
I'm going to call this standard
normal Z, so that's

82
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,600
easier to write.

83
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,100
And that's equal to negative 1
less than equal to Z, less

84
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,670
than equal to zero.

85
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,600
So we're looking for this
region, 0, 1, negative 1.

86
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:26,900

87
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:37,710
So that's just the probability
that it's less than zero minus

88
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:42,840
probability that it's less
than negative 1.

89
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:46,790
Well for a standard normal, half
the mass is below zero

90
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,490
and a half the mass is above.

91
00:04:48,490 --> 00:04:51,960
And so that's just going
to be 0.5 directly.

92
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:56,460
And for this, we've already
computed this for a standard

93
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,290
normal, which was
X in our case.

94
00:04:59,290 --> 00:05:09,868
And that was 1 minus 0.8413.

95
00:05:09,868 --> 00:05:10,870
Done.

96
00:05:10,870 --> 00:05:16,320
So we basically calculated a few
standard probabilities for

97
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:17,560
normal distributions.

98
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:20,950
And we did that by looking
them up from the standard

99
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:22,200
normal table.

100
00:05:22,200 --> 00:05:24,367
