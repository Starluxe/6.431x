Here's a fun problem.

3
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,110
A sheet of paper is
ruled with parallel lines

4
00:00:06,110 --> 00:00:09,230
that are at equal
distance from each other.

5
00:00:09,230 --> 00:00:13,740
I throw a needle on
the paper randomly.

6
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:15,700
What is the probability
that the needle will

7
00:00:15,700 --> 00:00:17,245
intersect one of the lines?

8
00:00:17,245 --> 00:00:25,933

11
00:00:33,290 --> 00:00:34,970
Here's another question.

12
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:39,630
A cell phone tower sends
signals carrying voice, text,

13
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,770
and digital data
to your cell phone.

14
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:46,040
These signals are always
corrupted by some noise.

15
00:00:46,040 --> 00:00:48,980
How would you describe
or model the noise?

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:51,230
And how would you
evaluate the probability

17
00:00:51,230 --> 00:00:53,345
that the signal is
incorrectly received?

18
00:00:53,345 --> 00:00:56,860


19
00:00:56,860 --> 00:00:59,650
In both of these examples,
we can model the underlying

20
00:00:59,650 --> 00:01:03,500
phenomena in terms of
continuous random variables.

21
00:01:03,500 --> 00:01:07,000
And in this unit, we will
develop methods to answer

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,630
the questions we raised.
