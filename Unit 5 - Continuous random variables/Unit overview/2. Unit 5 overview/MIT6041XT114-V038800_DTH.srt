1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,190

2
00:00:00,190 --> 00:00:03,830
In this unit, we more or less
repeat the entire development

3
00:00:03,830 --> 00:00:07,380
in the previous unit, except
that we will now consider

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:12,230
continuous rather than discrete
random variables.

5
00:00:12,230 --> 00:00:14,200
There are several reasons
for studying

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:16,550
continuous random variables.

7
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:20,620
The most important one is that
many quantities of interest,

8
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:24,900
for example, measurements of
time, length, or other

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:27,930
physical properties, are
naturally modeled as

10
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:29,880
continuous.

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:33,010
Another reason is that
continuous random variables

12
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:36,660
are sometimes easier to analyze,
because we can use

13
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,750
the machinery of calculus.

14
00:00:38,750 --> 00:00:41,370
For example, integrals
are often easier to

15
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,100
evaluate than sums.

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:46,790
A last reason is that continuous
models often

17
00:00:46,790 --> 00:00:48,830
provide a clean and simple

18
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:52,630
approximation of discrete models.

19
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:56,770
Our line of development will
parallel exactly what we did

20
00:00:56,770 --> 00:00:58,980
for the discrete case.

21
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,470
We will describe the
distribution of continuous

22
00:01:01,470 --> 00:01:04,950
random variables and talk
about expectations,

23
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:07,880
conditioning, and
independence.

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,900
As we will see, every formula
for the discrete case will

25
00:01:11,900 --> 00:01:14,120
have a continuous counterpart.

26
00:01:14,120 --> 00:01:16,880
The intuition will generally
be the same.

27
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:20,120
But there will be some
additional subtleties.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,130
These are due to the fact that
in a continuous model any

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,270
particular value of a random
variable has zero probability.

30
00:01:28,270 --> 00:01:32,190
And we will end this unit by
looking at variations of the

31
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:33,390
Bayes rule.

32
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:37,140
These will be the foundation
for our later study of the

33
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:39,760
subject of inference.

34
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:43,440
By the end of this unit, we will
have covered all of the

35
00:01:43,440 --> 00:01:47,260
major concepts and formulas that
are needed to describe

36
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:50,180
and analyze random variables
of all types.

37
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,430
