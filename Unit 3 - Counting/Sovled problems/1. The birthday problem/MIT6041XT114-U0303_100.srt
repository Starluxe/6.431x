1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,970

2
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,580
In this exercise, we'll be
looking at a problem,

3
00:00:03,580 --> 00:00:06,650
so-called the birthday paradox,
where we have n

4
00:00:06,650 --> 00:00:10,480
people and each person
has a random birthday

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,480
out of the 365 days.

6
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:16,520
And the probability we want to
measure is the probability of

7
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:19,595
the event that no two
birthdays coincide.

8
00:00:19,595 --> 00:00:26,820

9
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:30,360
To set up the problem, we'll
define the sample space omega

10
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:33,315
as a set of all possible
birthday combinations.

11
00:00:33,315 --> 00:00:36,830

12
00:00:36,830 --> 00:00:38,550
Let's see how big that is.

13
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:42,280
Well, we have a collection
of n people.

14
00:00:42,280 --> 00:00:46,810
And each person has
365 choices.

15
00:00:46,810 --> 00:00:50,310
And therefore, the total
number choices for all

16
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:54,570
possible birthday combinations
will be this number raised to

17
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:55,620
the power n.

18
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:00,370
So this will be the size of
our sample space omega.

19
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:04,360
Now, out of the sample space
we'll look at all choices, all

20
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:07,190
combinations where no
two people have

21
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:09,330
exactly the same birthday.

22
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:13,250
To count that, we can start from
the first person, person

23
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:14,070
number one.

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,330
Well, this person has 365
choices because so far there

25
00:01:18,330 --> 00:01:20,610
has not been any other
birthdays to

26
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:22,220
be conflicting with.

27
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,930
However, for the second person
we know that whatever the

28
00:01:24,930 --> 00:01:27,470
first person chose, we
cannot choose the

29
00:01:27,470 --> 00:01:28,610
same birthday again.

30
00:01:28,610 --> 00:01:34,350
And so we're left with
364 choices.

31
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:40,250
Keep going like this, we get
363, and so on and so forth.

32
00:01:40,250 --> 00:01:44,780
Until we reach the last person,
which will give us 365

33
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:47,740
minus n plus 1.

34
00:01:47,740 --> 00:01:52,630
Since we've repeated this
process n times.

35
00:01:52,630 --> 00:01:57,370
Now, looking at these two
numbers we know that the

36
00:01:57,370 --> 00:02:06,310
probability of no two birthdays
coincide is equal to

37
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,990
the size of the event, which
is this problem here--

38
00:02:09,990 --> 00:02:18,790
365 times 364, so on and so
forth, times 365 minus n plus

39
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:27,100
1, divided by the size of the
sample space, 365 raised to

40
00:02:27,100 --> 00:02:30,090
the nth power.

41
00:02:30,090 --> 00:02:33,360
Now, you might wonder how big
really is this probability?

42
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:37,840
Well, if we were to plot the
probability of having no two

43
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:41,230
birthdays coincide as a function
of the size of the

44
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:45,530
group n, where n goes from 0 all
the way to 80, we see that

45
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:48,000
the probability drops
very quickly.

46
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,100
In particular, if we were to
draw a line right here from

47
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:54,730
having 50 [percent]

48
00:02:54,730 --> 00:02:58,500
chance of seeing no two
birthdays coincide.

49
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:04,420
We see that roughly around 23
we're already are seeing a

50
00:03:04,420 --> 00:03:06,676
chance smaller than half.

51
00:03:06,676 --> 00:03:10,540
If the group size is about 40
and the chance of having a

52
00:03:10,540 --> 00:03:14,310
unique birthday for everyone
is only about 10%.

53
00:03:14,310 --> 00:03:17,580
Now, here on the right we are
plotting the same probability

54
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,900
but with a different scaling.

55
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:22,130
So on the y-axis we're plotting
with respect to a

56
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:26,390
logarithmic scaling, showing
a finer granularity of

57
00:03:26,390 --> 00:03:27,940
the value near zero.

58
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:31,890
Now we can see right here beyond
60 and the plot on the

59
00:03:31,890 --> 00:03:33,520
left that we solved before,
you can barely

60
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,090
tell the value p-n.

61
00:03:35,090 --> 00:03:39,660
So here if we were to track 60
around right here, we see that

62
00:03:39,660 --> 00:03:44,150
the values start dipping below
1% and all the way to 10 to

63
00:03:44,150 --> 00:03:44,950
the negative tenth.

64
00:03:44,950 --> 00:03:47,680
So that's a tiny number, even
though we only have a

65
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:50,420
group of size 120.

66
00:03:50,420 --> 00:03:52,067
