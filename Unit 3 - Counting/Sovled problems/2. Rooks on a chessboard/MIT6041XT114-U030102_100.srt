1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,970

2
00:00:01,970 --> 00:00:06,290
Today, we're going to do a fun
problem called rooks on a

3
00:00:06,290 --> 00:00:07,720
chessboard.

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:11,770
And rooks on a chessboard is a
problem that's going to test

5
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:15,010
your ability on counting.

6
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,840
So hopefully by now in class,
you've learned a few tricks to

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,300
approach counting problems.

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:23,360
You've learned about
permutations, you've learned

9
00:00:23,360 --> 00:00:26,690
about k-permutations, you've
learned about combinations,

10
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:29,160
and you've learned
about partitions.

11
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,460
And historically for students
that we've taught in the past

12
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:36,700
and many people, counting
can be a tricky topic.

13
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:40,500
So this is just one drill
problem to help you get those

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,450
skills under your belt.

15
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:48,120
So what does the rooks on a
chessboard problem ask you?

16
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,550
Well, you're given an 8-by-8
chessboard, which I've tried

17
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:54,210
to draw here.

18
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:55,350
It's not very symmetrical.

19
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:57,770
Sorry about that.

20
00:00:57,770 --> 00:01:01,950
And you're told that you
have eight rooks.

21
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:04,200
I'm sure most of you guys
are familiar with chess.

22
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:08,210
But if any of you aren't,
chess is a

23
00:01:08,210 --> 00:01:09,790
sophisticated board game.

24
00:01:09,790 --> 00:01:12,780
And one of the types of pieces
you have in this game is

25
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,840
called a rook.

26
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:15,450
And in this particular problem,

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:17,150
there are eight rooks.

28
00:01:17,150 --> 00:01:21,020
And your job is to place all
eight rooks onto this 8-by-8

29
00:01:21,020 --> 00:01:22,380
chessboard.

30
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:26,880
Now, you're told in the problem
statement that all

31
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:30,780
placements of rooks are
equally likely.

32
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,030
And you are tasked with finding
the probability that

33
00:01:38,030 --> 00:01:39,630
you get a safe arrangement.

34
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:42,920
So that is to say, you place
your eight rooks on the board.

35
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:44,940
What is the probability
that the way you

36
00:01:44,940 --> 00:01:47,320
placed them is safe?

37
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:49,160
So what do I mean by "safe"?

38
00:01:49,160 --> 00:01:55,900
Well, if you're familiar with
the way chess works, so if you

39
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:59,770
place a rook here, it can move
vertically or it can move

40
00:01:59,770 --> 00:02:00,680
horizontally.

41
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:03,360
Those are the only two
legal positions.

42
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,250
So if you place a rook here
and you have another piece

43
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:11,430
here, then this is not a safe
arrangement, because the rook

44
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:14,804
can move this way
and kill you.

45
00:02:14,804 --> 00:02:18,010
Similarly, if you have a rook
here and another piece here,

46
00:02:18,010 --> 00:02:21,120
the rook can move horizontally
and kill you that way.

47
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:25,870
So two rooks on this board are
only safe from each other if

48
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:30,060
they are neither in the same
column nor in the same row.

49
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:34,200
And that's going to be key for
us to solve this problem.

50
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:37,690
So let's see-- where
did my marker go?

51
00:02:37,690 --> 00:02:39,410
I've been talking a lot,
and I haven't really

52
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:40,520
been writing anything.

53
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:47,050
So our job is again, to find the
probability that you get a

54
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:50,100
safe arrangement.

55
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:53,570
So I'm just going to do
"arrange" for short.

56
00:02:53,570 --> 00:02:56,760
Now, I talked about this
previously, and you guys have

57
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,550
heard it in lecture.

58
00:02:58,550 --> 00:03:01,250
Hopefully you remember something
called the discrete

59
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,000
uniform law.

60
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,100
So the discrete uniform law is
applicable when your sample

61
00:03:07,100 --> 00:03:11,720
space is discrete and all
outcomes are equally likely.

62
00:03:11,720 --> 00:03:14,480
So let's do a quick
check here.

63
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,500
What is our sample space
for this problem?

64
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:21,510
Well, a logical choice would
be that the set of all

65
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:26,070
possible outcomes is the set
of all possible spatial

66
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,630
arrangements of rooks.

67
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:33,140
And hopefully it's clear to
you that that is discrete.

68
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,510
And the problem statement
furthermore gives us that

69
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,080
they're equally likely.

70
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:39,820
So the discrete uniform
law is in fact

71
00:03:39,820 --> 00:03:41,430
applicable in our setting.

72
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:45,690
So I'm going to go ahead and
write what this means.

73
00:03:45,690 --> 00:03:50,320
So when your sample space is
discrete and all outcomes are

74
00:03:50,320 --> 00:03:53,740
equally likely, then you can
compute the probability of any

75
00:03:53,740 --> 00:03:58,500
event, A, simply by counting
the number of outcomes in A

76
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,310
and then dividing it by the
total number of outcomes in

77
00:04:01,310 --> 00:04:02,820
your sample space.

78
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:06,500
So here we just have to find
the number of total safe

79
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:14,680
arrangements and then divide
it by the total number of

80
00:04:14,680 --> 00:04:15,930
arrangements.

81
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:17,990

82
00:04:17,990 --> 00:04:21,410
So again, as you've seen in
other problems, the discrete

83
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:24,310
uniform law is really nice,
because you reduce the problem

84
00:04:24,310 --> 00:04:27,970
of computing probabilities to
the problem of counting.

85
00:04:27,970 --> 00:04:29,980
And so here's where we're
going to exercise those

86
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,000
counting skills, as I
promised earlier.

87
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,630
Now, I would like to start
with computing the

88
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:40,370
denominator, or the total
number of arrangements,

89
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:44,280
because I think it's a slightly
easier computation.

90
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,775
So we don't care about the
arrangements being safe.

91
00:04:46,775 --> 00:04:49,700
We just care about
how many possible

92
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:51,760
arrangements are there.

93
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:55,190
Now, again, we have eight rooks,
and we need to place

94
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,770
all of them.

95
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,760
And we have this 8-by-8 board.

96
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:02,670
So pretty quickly, you guys
could probably tell me that

97
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:07,340
the total number of square
is 64, because this is

98
00:05:07,340 --> 00:05:10,950
just 8 times 8.

99
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:16,130
Now, I like to approach
problems sequentially.

100
00:05:16,130 --> 00:05:18,490
That sort of really helps me
think clearly about them.

101
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:22,330
So I want you to imagine a
sequential process during

102
00:05:22,330 --> 00:05:25,270
which we place each rook
one at a time.

103
00:05:25,270 --> 00:05:27,340
So pick a rook.

104
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:29,450
The chessboard is
currently empty.

105
00:05:29,450 --> 00:05:35,725
So how many squares can you
place that rook in?

106
00:05:35,725 --> 00:05:37,090
Well, nobody's on the board.

107
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,580
You can place it in 64 spots.

108
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:47,635
So for the first rook that you
pick, there are 64 spots.

109
00:05:47,635 --> 00:05:50,180

110
00:05:50,180 --> 00:05:53,790
Now, once you place this rook,
you need to place the second

111
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:55,430
rook, because again, we're
not done until

112
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:56,930
all eight are placed.

113
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:00,650
So how many possible
spots are left.

114
00:06:00,650 --> 00:06:04,300
Well, I claim that there are 63,
because one rule of chess

115
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:07,670
is that if you put a piece in
a particular square, you can

116
00:06:07,670 --> 00:06:09,550
no longer put anything
else on that square.

117
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:12,080
You can't put two
or more things.

118
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:16,650
So the first rook is occupying
one spot, so there's only 63

119
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,320
spots left.

120
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:25,360
So the second rook has 63 spots
that it could go in.

121
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,680
Similarly, the third
rook has 62 spots.

122
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,150
Hopefully you see the pattern.

123
00:06:33,150 --> 00:06:34,730
You can continue this down.

124
00:06:34,730 --> 00:06:37,310
And remember, we have to
place all eight rooks.

125
00:06:37,310 --> 00:06:40,330
So you could do it out
yourself or just

126
00:06:40,330 --> 00:06:42,030
do the simple math.

127
00:06:42,030 --> 00:06:46,560
You'll figure out that the
eighth rook only has 57 spots

128
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,810
that it could be in.

129
00:06:47,810 --> 00:06:51,610

130
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,000
So this is a good start.

131
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:56,460
We've sort of figured out if
we sequentially place each

132
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,330
rook, how many options
do we have.

133
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:03,910
But we haven't combined these
numbers in any useful way yet.

134
00:07:03,910 --> 00:07:08,265
We haven't counted the number
of total arrangements.

135
00:07:08,265 --> 00:07:10,800

136
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,690
And this may already be obvious
to some, but it wasn't

137
00:07:13,690 --> 00:07:16,130
obvious to me when I was first
learning this material, so I

138
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:18,960
want to go through
this slowly.

139
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,290
You have probably heard in
lecture by now about the

140
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:22,930
counting principle.

141
00:07:22,930 --> 00:07:25,820
And what the counting principle
tells you is that

142
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,430
whenever you have a process that
is done in stages and in

143
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:35,430
each stage, you have a
particular number of choices,

144
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,940
to get the total number of
choices available at the end

145
00:07:38,940 --> 00:07:42,420
of the process, you simply
multiply the number of choices

146
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,670
at each stage.

147
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:45,950

148
00:07:45,950 --> 00:07:48,170
This might be clear to you,
again, simply from the

149
00:07:48,170 --> 00:07:49,860
statement, for some of you.

150
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,980
But for others, it might
still not be clear.

151
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:54,390
So let's just take
a simple example.

152
00:07:54,390 --> 00:07:56,870
Forget about the rook problem
for a second.

153
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:59,520
Let's say you're at
a deli, and you

154
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:00,940
want to make a sandwich.

155
00:08:00,940 --> 00:08:04,510
And to make a sandwich, you need
a choice of bread and you

156
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:06,030
need a choice of meat.

157
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:08,020
So we have a sandwich-building
process,

158
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:09,160
and there's two stages.

159
00:08:09,160 --> 00:08:11,100
First, you have to pick the
bread, and then you have to

160
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:12,260
pick the meat.

161
00:08:12,260 --> 00:08:15,270
So let's say for the choice
of bread, you can

162
00:08:15,270 --> 00:08:18,700
choose wheat or rye.

163
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:22,270
So again, you can always use
a little decision tree--

164
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:24,490
wheat or rye.

165
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,480
And then let's say that
for the meats,

166
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,840
you have three options.

167
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:31,440
You have ham, turkey,
and salami.

168
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,460
So you can have ham,
turkey, or salami--

169
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:40,059
ham, turkey, or salami.

170
00:08:40,059 --> 00:08:43,210
How many total possible
sandwiches can you make?

171
00:08:43,210 --> 00:08:44,620
Well, six.

172
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:48,320
And I got to that
by 2 times 3.

173
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:51,130
And hopefully this makes sense
for you, because there's two

174
00:08:51,130 --> 00:08:54,220
options in the first stage.

175
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:56,090
Freeze an option.

176
00:08:56,090 --> 00:08:58,410
Given this choice, there's
three options

177
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:01,120
at the second stage.

178
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,350
But you have to also realize
that for every other option

179
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:09,450
you have at the first stage, you
have to add an additional

180
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:11,770
three options for the
second stage.

181
00:09:11,770 --> 00:09:15,540
And this is the definition
of multiplication.

182
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:19,260
If you add three two times,
you know that's 3 times 2.

183
00:09:19,260 --> 00:09:22,990
So if you extrapolate this
example to a larger, more

184
00:09:22,990 --> 00:09:26,620
general picture, you will have
derived for yourself the

185
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:28,860
counting principle.

186
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:33,800
And we're going to use the
counting principle here to

187
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:36,970
determine what the total number
of arrangements are.

188
00:09:36,970 --> 00:09:40,650
So we have a sequential process,
because we're placing

189
00:09:40,650 --> 00:09:43,340
the first rook and then the
second rook, et cetera.

190
00:09:43,340 --> 00:09:48,810
So at the first stage,
we have 64 choices.

191
00:09:48,810 --> 00:09:53,550
At the second stage,
we have 63 choices.

192
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:57,610
At the third stage, we have
62 choices, et cetera.

193
00:09:57,610 --> 00:10:01,000
And so I'm just multiplying
these numbers together,

194
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:04,220
because the counting principle
says I can do this.

195
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:10,320
So my claim is that this product
is equal to the total

196
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,580
number of arrangements.

197
00:10:13,580 --> 00:10:17,540
And we could stop here, but I'm
going to actually write

198
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:20,160
this in a more useful way.

199
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:22,920
You guys should have
been introduced to

200
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,510
the factorial function.

201
00:10:24,510 --> 00:10:29,800
So you can express this
equivalently as 64 factorial

202
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:32,530
divided by 56 factorial.

203
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:36,190
And this is not necessary for
your problem solution, but

204
00:10:36,190 --> 00:10:38,340
sometimes it's helpful to
express these types of

205
00:10:38,340 --> 00:10:41,170
products in factorials,
because you can see

206
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:44,210
cancellations more easily.

207
00:10:44,210 --> 00:10:48,300
So if it's OK with everybody,
I'm going to erase this work

208
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:51,580
to give myself more room.

209
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:56,310
So we'll just put our answer for
the denominator up here,

210
00:10:56,310 --> 00:11:00,230
and then we're going to get
started on the numerator.

211
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:04,170
So for the numerator, thanks to
the discrete uniform law,

212
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:09,410
we only need to count the number
of safe arrangements.

213
00:11:09,410 --> 00:11:12,100
But this is a little bit more
tricky, because now, we have

214
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:15,420
to apply our definition
of what "safe" means.

215
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:18,440
But we're going to use the same
higher-level strategy,

216
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:22,510
which is realizing that we can
place rooks sequentially.

217
00:11:22,510 --> 00:11:25,810
So we can think of it as
a sequential process.

218
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:29,940
And then if we figure out how
many choices you have in each

219
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:35,040
stage that sort of maintain the
"safeness" of the setup,

220
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:37,680
then you can use the counting
principle to multiply all

221
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,250
those numbers together
and get your answer.

222
00:11:41,250 --> 00:11:45,060
So we have to place
eight rooks.

223
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:49,210
Starting the same way we did
last time, how many spots are

224
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,880
there for the first rook
that are safe?

225
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:56,520
Nobody is on the board yet, so
nobody can harm the first rook

226
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:57,500
we put down.

227
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,940
So I claim that it's just
our total of 64.

228
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:04,050
Now, let's see what happens.

229
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:05,740
Let's pick a random
square in here.

230
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:08,520
Let's say we put our
first rook here.

231
00:12:08,520 --> 00:12:13,210
Now, I claim a bunch of spots
get invalidated because of the

232
00:12:13,210 --> 00:12:14,390
rules of chess.

233
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:18,570
So before, I told you a rook can
kill anything in the same

234
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,680
column or in the same row.

235
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:25,020
So you can't put a rook here,
because they'll kill each

236
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,250
other, and you can't
put a rook here.

237
00:12:27,250 --> 00:12:33,250
So by extension, you can see
that everything in the column

238
00:12:33,250 --> 00:12:36,970
and the row that I'm
highlighting in blue, it's no

239
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:37,850
longer an option.

240
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:39,880
You can't place a
rook in there.

241
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,780
Otherwise, we will
have violated

242
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:45,140
our "safety" principle.

243
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:50,580
So where can our
second rook go?

244
00:12:50,580 --> 00:12:55,140
Well, our second rook can go in
any of the blank spots, any

245
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:57,630
of the spots that are not
highlighted by blue.

246
00:12:57,630 --> 00:13:00,110
And let's stare at this
a little bit.

247
00:13:00,110 --> 00:13:02,640

248
00:13:02,640 --> 00:13:06,560
Imagine that you were to take
scissors to your chessboard

249
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:09,370
and cut along this line
and this line and this

250
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:10,200
line and this line.

251
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:14,190
So you essentially sawed off
this cross that we created.

252
00:13:14,190 --> 00:13:18,470
Then you would have four
free-floating chessboard

253
00:13:18,470 --> 00:13:23,070
pieces-- this one, this one,
this one, and this one.

254
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:27,650
So this is a 3-by-4 piece,
this is 3-by-3, this is

255
00:13:27,650 --> 00:13:30,020
4-by-3, and this is 4-by-4.

256
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:33,600
Well, because you cut this part
out, you can now slide

257
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:36,000
those pieces back together.

258
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:39,950
And hopefully you can convince
yourself that that would leave

259
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:43,390
you with a 7-by-7 chessboard.

260
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:48,650
And you can see that the
dimensions match up here.

261
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:53,000
So essentially, the second rook
can be placed anywhere in

262
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:55,970
the remaining 7-by-7
chessboard.

263
00:13:55,970 --> 00:14:00,280
And of course, there are 49
spots in a 7-by-7 chessboard.

264
00:14:00,280 --> 00:14:03,430
So you get 49.

265
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:07,150
So let's do this experiment
again.

266
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:11,860
Let me rewrite the reduced
7-by-7 chessboard.

267
00:14:11,860 --> 00:14:14,540
You're going to have to forgive
me if the lines are

268
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,680
not perfect--

269
00:14:16,680 --> 00:14:22,760
one, two, three, four, five,
six, seven; one, two, three,

270
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,210
four, five, six, seven.

271
00:14:23,210 --> 00:14:24,630
Yep, I did that right.

272
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:32,030
And then we have one, two,
three, four, five, six, seven.

273
00:14:32,030 --> 00:14:36,800
That's not too bad for
my first attempt.

274
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,980
So again, how did I get this
chessboard from this one?

275
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:43,210
Well, I took scissors and I cut
off of the blue strips,

276
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:46,690
and then I just merged the
remaining four pieces.

277
00:14:46,690 --> 00:14:50,160
So now, I'm placing
my second rook.

278
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:54,350
So I know that I can place my
second rook in any of these

279
00:14:54,350 --> 00:14:58,770
squares, and it'll be
safe from this rook.

280
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:00,830
Of course, in reality, you
wouldn't really cut up your

281
00:15:00,830 --> 00:15:01,390
chessboard.

282
00:15:01,390 --> 00:15:05,470
I'm just using this as a visual
aid to help you guys

283
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:08,220
see why there are 49 spots.

284
00:15:08,220 --> 00:15:11,020
Another way you could see 49
spots is literally just by

285
00:15:11,020 --> 00:15:15,890
counting all the white squares,
but I think it takes

286
00:15:15,890 --> 00:15:17,720
time to count 49 squares.

287
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,501
And this is a faster
way of seeing it.

288
00:15:20,501 --> 00:15:23,930
So you can put your second
rook anywhere here.

289
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:26,340
Let's actually put in the
corner, because the corner is

290
00:15:26,340 --> 00:15:27,590
a nice case.

291
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:30,700
If you put your rook in the
corner, immediately, all the

292
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:35,360
spots in here and all the spots
in here become invalid

293
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:38,230
for the third rook, because
otherwise, the rooks can hurt

294
00:15:38,230 --> 00:15:40,070
each other.

295
00:15:40,070 --> 00:15:45,130
So again, you'll see that if you
take scissors and cut off

296
00:15:45,130 --> 00:15:47,940
the blue part, you will have
reduced the dimension of the

297
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:49,730
chessboard again.

298
00:15:49,730 --> 00:15:52,820
And you can see pretty quickly
that what you're left with is

299
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:55,100
a 6-by-6 chessboard.

300
00:15:55,100 --> 00:16:02,820
So for the third rook, you get a
6-by-6 chessboard, which has

301
00:16:02,820 --> 00:16:06,020
36 free spots.

302
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,880
And I'm not going to insult
your intelligence.

303
00:16:08,880 --> 00:16:11,280
You guys can see the pattern--

304
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:13,130
64, 49, 36.

305
00:16:13,130 --> 00:16:16,310
These are just perfect
squares decreasing.

306
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:21,740
So you know that the fourth
rook will have 25 spots.

307
00:16:21,740 --> 00:16:24,840
I'm going to come over here
because I'm out of room.

308
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:27,970
The fifth rook will
have 16 spots.

309
00:16:27,970 --> 00:16:31,230
The sixth rook will
have nine spots.

310
00:16:31,230 --> 00:16:33,900
The seventh rook will
have four spots.

311
00:16:33,900 --> 00:16:37,780
And the eighth rook will
just have one spot.

312
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,360
And now, here we're going
to invoke the

313
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:40,880
counting principle again.

314
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,930
Remember the thing that I just
defined to you by talking

315
00:16:43,930 --> 00:16:46,680
about sandwiches.

316
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:49,240
And we'll see that to get
the total number of safe

317
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,860
arrangements, we can
just multiply

318
00:16:50,860 --> 00:16:52,910
these numbers together.

319
00:16:52,910 --> 00:16:54,750
So I'm going to go ahead
and put that up here.

320
00:16:54,750 --> 00:17:02,360
You get 64 times 49 times
36 times 25 times 16

321
00:17:02,360 --> 00:17:05,079
times 9 times 4.

322
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,810
And in fact, this
is our answer.

323
00:17:07,810 --> 00:17:10,859
So we're all done.

324
00:17:10,859 --> 00:17:15,630
So I really like this problem,
because we don't normally ask

325
00:17:15,630 --> 00:17:18,690
you to think about different
spatial arrangements.

326
00:17:18,690 --> 00:17:22,339
So it's a nice exercise, because
it lets you practice

327
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:27,069
your counting skills in a
new and creative way.

328
00:17:27,069 --> 00:17:31,220
And in particular, the thing
that we've been using for a

329
00:17:31,220 --> 00:17:33,730
while now is the discrete
uniform law.

330
00:17:33,730 --> 00:17:36,730
But now, I also introduced
the counting principle.

331
00:17:36,730 --> 00:17:39,310
And we used the counting
principle twice--

332
00:17:39,310 --> 00:17:41,910
once to compute the numerator
and once to compute the

333
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:44,210
denominator.

334
00:17:44,210 --> 00:17:49,480
Counting can take a long time
for you to absorb it.

335
00:17:49,480 --> 00:17:52,850
So if you still don't totally
buy the counting

336
00:17:52,850 --> 00:17:54,450
principle, that's OK.

337
00:17:54,450 --> 00:17:59,440
I just recommend you do some
more examples and try to

338
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:02,280
convince yourself that it's
really counting the right

339
00:18:02,280 --> 00:18:04,020
number of things.

340
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:07,510
So counting principle is
the second takeaway.

341
00:18:07,510 --> 00:18:10,520
And then the other thing that
is just worth mentioning is,

342
00:18:10,520 --> 00:18:12,980
you guys should get really
comfortable with these

343
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:19,960
factorials, because they will
just show up again and again.

344
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:21,960
So that's the end of the
problem, and I'll

345
00:18:21,960 --> 00:18:23,210
see you next time.

346
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,134
