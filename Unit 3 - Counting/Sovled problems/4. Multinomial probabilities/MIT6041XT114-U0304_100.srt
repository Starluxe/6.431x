1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,580

2
00:00:00,580 --> 00:00:03,520
In this segment, we will discuss
the multinomial, and

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:06,000
the multinomial probabilities,
which are a nice

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,090
generalization of the binomial
probabilities.

5
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,930
The setting is as follows.

6
00:00:10,930 --> 00:00:11,895
We're dealing with balls.

7
00:00:11,895 --> 00:00:14,170
And the balls come into
different colors.

8
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:17,240
There are r possible
different colors.

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:18,670
We pick a ball at random.

10
00:00:18,670 --> 00:00:22,490
And when we do that, there's a
certain probability p-i that

11
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:25,410
the ball that we picked,
has the i-th color.

12
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:29,160
Now, we repeat this process,
n times independently, each

13
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,270
time, we get a ball that
has a random color.

14
00:00:32,270 --> 00:00:35,660
And we're interested in the
following kind of question.

15
00:00:35,660 --> 00:00:38,450
Somebody fixes for us
certain numbers--

16
00:00:38,450 --> 00:00:44,430
n1, n2, up to nr that add up to
n, and asks us, what is the

17
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:47,050
probability that when you carry
out the experiment, you

18
00:00:47,050 --> 00:00:51,410
get exactly n1 balls of the
first color, exactly n2 balls

19
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:53,930
of the second color,
and so on.

20
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:59,640
So the numbers n1, n2, and up to
nr are fixed given numbers.

21
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:01,910
For a particular choice of
those numbers, we want to

22
00:01:01,910 --> 00:01:04,680
calculate this probability.

23
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:07,300
Now of course, this is
a more general model.

24
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,350
It doesn't necessarily
deal with balls

25
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:10,770
of different colors.

26
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:15,480
For example, we might have an
experiment that gives us

27
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:20,120
random numbers where the numbers
range from 1 up to r.

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:23,970
And, at each time, we get
a random number, with

29
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:25,130
probability p-i.

30
00:01:25,130 --> 00:01:27,850
We get a number which
is equal to i.

31
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:32,440
So we could use this to model
die rolls, for example.

32
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,290
And there's actually a special
case of this problem, which

33
00:01:35,290 --> 00:01:36,720
should be familiar.

34
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,120
Suppose that we have
only two colors.

35
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:42,570
And instead of thinking of
colors, let's think of the two

36
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:46,980
possibilities as being
heads or tails.

37
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:49,100
And we can make the
following analogy.

38
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:55,730
Somebody gives us numbers, n1
and n2 that add up to n.

39
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:59,050
And we're interested in the
probability that we get n1 of

40
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:02,310
the first color and n2
of the second color.

41
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,950
Well, we could think of this
as a setting in which we're

42
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:12,570
asking for the probability that
we obtain k heads and n

43
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,610
minus k tails.

44
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:17,560

45
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:21,030
So the question of what is the
probability that we obtain k

46
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:25,470
heads and n minus k tails is
of the same kind as what is

47
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:29,270
the probability that we get n1
of the first color and n2 of

48
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,820
the second color.

49
00:02:30,820 --> 00:02:34,580
Now, if heads have the
probability p of occurring,

50
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,730
and tails has a probability of
1 minus p of occurring, then

51
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:41,305
we would have the following
analogy: the probability of

52
00:02:41,305 --> 00:02:45,040
obtaining the first color, which
correspond to heads,

53
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:46,960
that would be equal to p.

54
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,590
The probability of obtaining
the second color, which

55
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:50,720
corresponds to tails.

56
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,050
This would be 1 minus p.

57
00:02:54,050 --> 00:02:58,850
Now, the probability of
obtaining k heads in those n

58
00:02:58,850 --> 00:03:02,780
independent trials we
know what it is.

59
00:03:02,780 --> 00:03:07,720
By the binomial probabilities,
it is n choose k times p to

60
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,970
the k times 1 minus p to
the power n minus k.

61
00:03:13,970 --> 00:03:18,570
Now we can translate this answer
to the multinomial

62
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:21,720
case, where we're dealing with
colors, and we do these

63
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:23,500
substitutions.

64
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:30,990
So n choose k is n factorial
divided by k factorial.

65
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:35,040
In this case, k is
the same as n1.

66
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,570
So we get an n1 factorial.

67
00:03:37,570 --> 00:03:40,830
And then we're going to have
here n minus k factorial.

68
00:03:40,830 --> 00:03:43,920
But n minus k corresponds
to n2.

69
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,750
So here we get an
n2 factorial.

70
00:03:47,750 --> 00:03:49,650
And then p corresponds to p1.

71
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,080

72
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:58,020
And p2 corresponds
to 1 minus p.

73
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:01,250
So we get here p1 times p2.

74
00:04:01,250 --> 00:04:06,720
And the power n minus k, again,
by analogy, is n2.

75
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,850
So this is the form of the
multinomial probabilities for

76
00:04:10,850 --> 00:04:13,470
the special case where we're
dealing with two colors.

77
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:16,060

78
00:04:16,060 --> 00:04:19,149
Let's now look at the
general case.

79
00:04:19,149 --> 00:04:20,820
Let's start with an example.

80
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,080
To be concrete, suppose that the
number of colors is equal

81
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:33,780
to 3 and that we're going to
pick n equal to 7 balls.

82
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,540
We carry out the experiment.

83
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:39,660
And we might obtain an outcome
which would be a

84
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:41,310
sequence of this type.

85
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:44,560
So the first ball had
the color one.

86
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,760
The second ball had
the first color.

87
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,460
The third ball had
the third color.

88
00:04:49,460 --> 00:04:53,720
The fourth had the first
color, and so on.

89
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,680
And suppose that this
was the outcome.

90
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,260
One way of summarizing what
happened in this outcome would

91
00:05:01,260 --> 00:05:06,035
be to say that we
had four ones.

92
00:05:06,035 --> 00:05:09,670

93
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:16,600
We had two twos, and
we had one three.

94
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:21,810
We would say that this is
the type of the outcome.

95
00:05:21,810 --> 00:05:23,740
It's of type 4, 2, 1.

96
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:27,440
That is, we obtain 4 of the
first color, 2 of the second

97
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,440
color, and 1 of the
third color.

98
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,420

99
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:34,590
This is one possible outcome.

100
00:05:34,590 --> 00:05:36,690
What is the probability
of obtaining

101
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:39,610
this particular outcome?

102
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:43,570
The probability of obtaining
this particular outcome is,

103
00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:46,690
using independence, the
probability that we obtain

104
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:49,750
color 1 in the first trial.

105
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:55,250
color 1 in the second trial,
color 3 in the third trial,

106
00:05:55,250 --> 00:06:00,300
color 1 in the fourth trial,
color 2 in the next trial,

107
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,980
color 2 in the next trial, color
1 in the last trial.

108
00:06:04,980 --> 00:06:08,590
And we put all of the
factors together.

109
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:13,380
And we notice that this is p1
to the fourth, p2 to the

110
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:16,050
second, times p3.

111
00:06:16,050 --> 00:06:19,410

112
00:06:19,410 --> 00:06:22,620
It's not a coincidence that the
exponents that we have up

113
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:27,590
here are exactly the counts that
we had when we specified

114
00:06:27,590 --> 00:06:32,000
the type of this particular
outcome.

115
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:36,310
Generalizing from this example,
we realize that the

116
00:06:36,310 --> 00:06:39,780
probability of obtaining a
particular sequence of a

117
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:46,100
certain type, that probability
is of this form.

118
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:49,980
For each color, we have the
probability of that color

119
00:06:49,980 --> 00:06:53,440
raised to the power of how many
times that particular

120
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,200
color appears in a sequence.

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:00,780
So any particular sequence
of this type has this

122
00:07:00,780 --> 00:07:02,020
probability.

123
00:07:02,020 --> 00:07:06,460
What we're interested in is to
find the total probability of

124
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:10,180
obtaining some sequence
of this type.

125
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:12,270
How can we find this
probability?

126
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,330
Well, we will take the
probability of each sequence

127
00:07:15,330 --> 00:07:20,050
of this type, which is this
much, and it's the same for

128
00:07:20,050 --> 00:07:24,730
any particular sequence, and
multiply with the number of

129
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:27,980
sequences of this type.

130
00:07:27,980 --> 00:07:32,120
So how many sequences are
there of a certain type?

131
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,160
Let's look back at
our example.

132
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,340
We had seven trials.

133
00:07:37,340 --> 00:07:42,600
So let us number here the
different trials.

134
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:46,560
And when I tell you that a
particular sequence was

135
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:54,880
obtained, that's the same as
telling you that, in this set

136
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:00,125
of trials, we had
the first color.

137
00:08:00,125 --> 00:08:03,700

138
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:09,130
In this set of trials, the fifth
and the sixth trial, we

139
00:08:09,130 --> 00:08:13,260
had the second color.

140
00:08:13,260 --> 00:08:19,770
And in this trial, the third
trial, we had the third color.

141
00:08:19,770 --> 00:08:22,610
This is an alternative
way of telling you

142
00:08:22,610 --> 00:08:24,310
what sequence we obtained.

143
00:08:24,310 --> 00:08:27,690
I tell you at which trials we
had the first color, at which

144
00:08:27,690 --> 00:08:32,530
trials we had the second, at
which trials we had the third.

145
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:33,900
But what do we have here?

146
00:08:33,900 --> 00:08:39,530
Here we have a partition of the
set of numbers from 1 up

147
00:08:39,530 --> 00:08:43,179
to 7 into three subsets.

148
00:08:43,179 --> 00:08:48,240
And the cardinalities of those
subsets are the numbers that

149
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,440
appear here in the type
of the sequence.

150
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:59,100
The conclusion is that a
sequence of a certain type is

151
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:03,760
equivalent, or can be
alternatively specified, by

152
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:11,370
giving you a partition of the
set of tosses, which is the

153
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:17,150
set from 1 up to n, how many
trials we had, a partition

154
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:20,390
into subsets of certain sizes.

155
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:25,160
So this allows us now to count
the number of sequences of a

156
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:26,320
certain type.

157
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,610
It's exactly the same as the
number of partitions.

158
00:09:29,610 --> 00:09:31,550
And we know what this is.

159
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,690
And putting everything together,
the probability of

160
00:09:34,690 --> 00:09:39,280
obtaining a sequence of a
certain type is equal to the

161
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:43,940
count of how many sequences do
we have of a certain type,

162
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:46,330
which is the same as the number
of partitions of a

163
00:09:46,330 --> 00:09:50,340
certain type, times the
probability of any particular

164
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:55,830
sequence of that type that
we're interested in.

165
00:09:55,830 --> 00:09:59,460
So this is a formula that
generalizes the one that we

166
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:03,340
saw before for the case where
we have only two colors and

167
00:10:03,340 --> 00:10:07,930
which corresponded to the
coin tossing setting.

168
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,400
And it is a useful model because
you can think of many

169
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:14,100
situations in which you have
repeated trials, and, at each

170
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:18,230
trial, you obtain one
out of a finite

171
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:20,510
set of possible results.

172
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:23,100
There are r different
possible results.
